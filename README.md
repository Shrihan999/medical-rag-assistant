Medical Knowledge Chatbot with RAG Integration

Introduction

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Mistral 7B Large Language Model (LLM) on a comprehensive dataset of 250,000 medical question-answer (QA) pairs. The objective is to create a powerful medical chatbot that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using ChromaDB. By combining fine-tuned expertise and real-time retrieval, the chatbot will deliver accurate and up-to-date medical information to users.

Methodology

Data Preparation:

Cleaning and preprocessing the medical QA dataset to ensure quality and consistency.

Formatting the data to meet the requirements of the Mistral 7B fine-tuning process.

Model Fine-Tuning:

Fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model using the prepared medical dataset.

Utilizing optimization techniques such as mixed-precision training for performance and efficiency.

RAG Integration:

Setting up ChromaDB as the retrieval backend.

Integrating RAG to allow dynamic retrieval and synthesis of recent and trusted medical information.

System Deployment:

Developing a scalable backend to host the fine-tuned model and RAG system.

Designing a user-friendly chatbot interface for seamless interactions.

Evaluation and Testing:

Assessing the chatbotâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.

Conducting rigorous testing to ensure reliability and compliance with medical information standards.
