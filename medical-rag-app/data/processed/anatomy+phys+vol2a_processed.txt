Unit 1: Levels of Organization Chapters 1‚Äì4 provide students with a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language, thelevelsoforganization,andthebasicsofchemistryandcellbiology.ThesechaptersprovideafoundationforthefurtherstudyPREFACE 7 of the body.
They also focus particularly on how the body‚Äôs regions, important chemicals, and cells maintain homeostasis.
Chapter 1 An Introduction to the Human BodyChapter 2 The Chemical Level of OrganizationChapter 3 The Cellular Level of OrganizationChapter 4 The Tissue Level of Organization Unit 2: Support and Movement In Chapters 5‚Äì11, students explore the skin, the largest organ of the body, and examine the body‚Äôs skeletal and muscular systems, following a traditional sequence of topics.
This unit is the first to walk students through specific systems of thebody, and as it does so, it maintains a focus on homeostasis as well as those diseases and conditions that can disrupt it.Chapter 5 The Integumentary SystemChapter 6 Bone and Skeletal TissueChapter 7 The Axial SkeletonChapter 8 The Appendicular SkeletonChapter 9 JointsChapter 10 Muscle TissueChapter 11 The Muscular System Unit 3: Regulation, Integration, and Control Chapters12‚Äì17helpstudentsanswerquestionsaboutnervousandendocrinesystemcontrolandregulation.Inabreakwiththe traditional sequence of topics, the special senses are integrated into the chapter on the somatic nervous system.
Thechapter on the neurological examination offers students a unique approac h to understanding nervous system function using five simple but powerful diagnostic tests.Chapter 12 Introduction to the Nervous SystemChapter 13 The Anatomy of the Nervous SystemChapter 14 The Somatic Nervous SystemChapter 15 The Autonomic Nervous SystemChapter 16 The Neurological ExamChapter 17 The Endocrine System Unit 5: Energy, Maintenance, and Environmental Exchange In Chapters 22‚Äì26, students discover the interaction between body systems and the outside environment for the exchangeof materials, the capture of energy, the release of waste, and the overall maintenance of the internal systems that regulatethe exchange.
The explanations and illustrations are particular ly focused on how structure relates to function.
Chapter 22 The Respiratory SystemChapter 23 The Digestive SystemChapter 24 Nutrition and MetabolismChapter 25 The Urinary SystemChapter 26 Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid‚ÄìBase Balance Unit 6: Human Development and the Continuity of Life The closing chapters examine the male and female reproductive systems, describe the process of human development andthe different stages of pregnancy, and end with a review of the mechanisms of inheritance.Chapter 27 The Reproductive SystemChapter 28 Development and Genetic Inheritance Pedagogical Foundation and Features Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed to promote scientific literacy.
Throughout the text, you will find features that engage the students by taking selected topics a step further.
Homeostatic Imbalances discusses the effects and results of imbalances in the body.
Disorders showcases a disorder that is relevant to the body system at hand.
This feature may focus on a specific disorder, or a set of related disorders.Diseases showcases a disease that is relevant to the body system at hand .
Agingexplores the effect aging has on a body‚Äôs system and specific disorders that manifest over time.
Career Connections presents information on the various careers often pursued by allied healt h students, such as medicaltechnician,medicalexaminer,andneurophysiologist.Studentsareintroducedtotheeducationalrequirementsfor and day-to-day responsibilities in these careers.Everyday Connections tie anatomical and physiological concepts to emerging issues and discuss these in terms of everyday life.
Topics include ‚ÄúAnabolic Steroids‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Effe ct of Second-Hand Tobacco Smoke.‚Äù Interactive Links direct students to online exercises, simulations, animations, and videos to add a fuller context to core content and help improve understanding of the material.
Many features include links to the University ofMichigan‚ÄôsinteractiveWebScopes,whichallowstudentstozoominonmicrographsinthecollection.Theseresourceswere vetted by reviewers and other subject matter experts to ensure that they are effective and accurate.
We strongly8 PREFACE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology- volume-2/ or at http://cnx.org/content/c ol11496/1.6 urge students to explore these links, whether viewing a video or inputting data into a simulation, to gain the fullest experience and to learn how to search for information independe ntly.
Dynamic, Learner-Centered Art Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration.The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions andinstructional innovations.
Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations.
The stron gest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape.
Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarifythe primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration.
This technique is intended to draw students‚Äô attention to thecriticallearningpointintheillustration,withoutdistractionfromex cessivegradients,shadows,andhighlights.Fullcoloris used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).
By highlighting the most important portions of the illustration, the artwork helps students focus on the most importantpoints, without overwhelming them.
Micrographs Micrograph magnifications have been calculated based on the objective provided with the image.
If a micrograph wasrecorded at 40√ó, and the image was magnified an additional 2√ó, we calculated the final magnification of the micrograph tobe 80√ó.

In Peter D. Kramer‚Äôs book Listening to Prozac, a pharmaceutical researcher is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúIf the human brain were simple enough for us to understand, we would be too simple to understand it‚Äù (1994).
That quote is from the early 1990s; in the two decades since, progress has continued at an amazing rate within the scientific disciplines of neuroscience.
It is an interesting conundrum to consider that the complexity of the nervous system may be too complex for it (that is, for us) to completely unravel.
But our current level of understanding is probably nowhere close to that limit.
One easy way to begin to understand the structure of the nervous system is to start with the large divisions and work through to a more in-depth understanding.
In other chapters, the finer details of the nervous system will be explained, but first looking at an overview of the system will allow you to begin to understand how its parts work together.
The focus of this chapter is on nervous (neural) tissue, both its structure and its function.
But before you learn about that, you will see a big picture of the system‚Äîactually, a few big pictures.
12.1|Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the anatomical and functional divisions of the nervous system ‚Ä¢Relate the functional and structural differences between gray matter and white matter structures of the nervous system to the structure of neurons ‚Ä¢List the basic functions of the nervous system The picture you have in your mind of the nervous system probably includes the brain, the nervous tissue contained within the cranium, and the spinal cord, the extension of nervous tissue within the vertebral column.
That suggests it is made of two organs‚Äîand you may not even think of the spinal cord as an organ‚Äîbut the nervous system is a very complex structure.Withinthebrain,manydifferentandseparateregionsareresponsibleformanydifferentandseparatefunctions.It is as if the nervous system is composed of many organs that all look similar and can only be differentiated using tools such as the microscope or electrophysiology.
In comparison, it is easy to see that the stomach is different than the esophagus or the liver, so you can imagine the digestive system as a collection of specific organs.
The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems Thenervoussystemcanbedividedintotwomajorregions:thecentralandperipheralnervoussystems.The centralnervous system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything else (Figure 12.2 ).
The brain is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord is contained within the vertebral cavity of the vertebral column.
It is a bit of an oversimplification to say that the CNS is what is inside these two cavities and the peripheral nervous system is outside of them, but that is one way to start to think about it.
In actuality, there are some elements of the peripheral nervous system that are within the cranial or vertebral cavities.
The peripheral nervous system is so named because it is on the periphery‚Äîmeaning beyond the brain and spinal cord.
Depending on different aspects of the nervous system, the dividing line between central and peripheral is not necessarily universal.470 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 12.2 Central and Peripheral Nervous System The structures of the PNS are referred to as ganglia and nerves, which can be seen as distinct structures.
The equivalent structures in the CNS are not obvious from this overall perspective and are best examined in prepared tissue under the microscope.
Nervous tissue, present in both the CNS and PNS, contains two basic types of cells: neurons and glial cells.
A glial cellisoneof avarietyof cellsthatprovideaframeworkof tissuethatsupports theneurons andtheiractivities.The neuron is the more functionally important of the two, in terms of the communicative function of the nervous system.
To describe thefunctionaldivisionsofthenervoussystem,itisimportanttounderstandthestructureofaneuron.Neuronsarecellsand therefore have a soma, or cell body, but they also have extensions of the cell; each extension is generally referred to as a process.Thereisoneimportantprocessthateveryneuronhascalledan axon,whichisthefiberthatconnectsaneuronwith its target.
Another type of process that branches off from the soma is the dendrite.
Dendrites are responsible for receiving most of the input from other neurons.
Looking at nervous tissue, there are regions that predominantly contain cell bodies and regions that are largely composed of just axons.
These two regions within nervous system structures are often referred toasgraymatter (theregionswithmanycellbodiesanddendrites)or whitematter (theregionswithmanyaxons).
Figure 12.3demonstrates the appearance of these regions in the brain and spinal cord.
The colors ascribed to these regions are whatwouldbeseenin‚Äúfresh,‚Äùorunstained,nervoustissue.Graymatterisnotnecessarilygray.Itcanbepinkishbecauseof bloodcontent,orevenslightlytan,dependingonhowlongthetissuehasbeenpreserved.Butwhitematteriswhitebecause axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin.
Lipids can appear as white (‚Äúfatty‚Äù) material, much like the fat on a raw piece of chicken or beef.
Actually, gray matter may have that color ascribed to it because next to the white matter, it is just darker‚Äîhence, gray.
The distinction between gray matter and white matter is most often applied to central nervous tissue, which has large regions that can be seen with the unaided eye.
When looking at peripheral structures, often a microscope is used and the tissue is stained with artificial colors.
That is not to say that central nervous tissue cannot be stained and viewed under a microscope, but unstained tissue is most likely from the CNS‚Äîfor example, a frontal section of the brain or cross section of the spinal cord.CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 471 Figure 12.3 Gray Matter and White Matter A brain removed during an autopsy, with a partial section removed, shows white matter surrounded by gray matter.
Gray matter makes up the outer cortex of the brain.
(credit: modification of work by ‚ÄúSuseno‚Äù/Wikimedia Commons) Regardless of the appearance of stained or unstained tissue, the cell bodies of neurons or axons can be located in discrete anatomical structures that need to be named.
Those names are specific to whether the structure is central or peripheral.
A localized collection of neuron cell bodies in the CNS is referred to as a nucleus.
In the PNS, a cluster of neuron cell bodies is referred to as a ganglion.
Figure 12.4 indicates how the term nucleus has a few different meanings within anatomy and physiology.
It is the center of an atom, where protons and neutrons are found; it is the center of a cell, where the DNA is found; and it is a center of some function in the CNS.
There is also a potentially confusing use of the word ganglion (plural = ganglia) that has a historical explanation.
In the central nervous system, there is a group of nuclei that are connected together and were once called the basal ganglia before ‚Äúganglion‚Äù became accepted as a description for a peripheral structure.
Some sources refer to this group of nuclei as the ‚Äúbasal nuclei‚Äù to avoid confusion.
Figure 12.4 What Is a Nucleus?
(a) The nucleus of an atom contains its protons and neutrons.
(b) The nucleus of a cell is the organelle that contains DNA.
(c) A nucleus in the CNS is a localized center of function with the cell bodies of several neurons, shown here circled in red.
(credit c: ‚ÄúWas a bee‚Äù/Wikimedia Commons) Terminologyappliedtobundlesofaxonsalsodiffersdependingonlocation.Abundleofaxons,orfibers,foundinthe CNS is called a tractwhereas the same thing in the PNS would be called a nerve.
There is an important point to make about these terms, which is that they can both be used to refer to the same bundle of axons.
When those axons are in the PNS, the term is nerve, but if they are CNS, the term is tract.
The most obvious example of this is the axons that project from the retina into the brain.
Those axons are called the optic nerve as they leave the eye, but when they are inside the cranium,theyarereferredtoastheoptictract.Thereisaspecificplacewherethenamechanges,whichistheopticchiasm, but they are still the same axons ( Figure 12.5 ).
A similar situation outside of science can be described for some roads.

Table 12.1 helps to clarify which of these terms apply to the central or peripheral nervous systems.472 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 12.5 Optic Nerve Versus Optic Tract This drawing of the connections of the eye to the brain shows the optic nerve extending from the eye to the chiasm, where the structure continues as the optic tract.
The same axons extend from the eye to the brain through these two bundles of fibers, but the chiasm represents the border between peripheral and central.
In 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for discoveries related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
This is a tool to see the structures of the body (not just the nervous system) that depends on magnetic fields associated with certain atomic nuclei.
The utility of this technique in the nervous system is that fat tissue and water appear as different shades between black and white.
Because white matter is fatty (from myelin) and gray matter is not, they can be easily distinguished in MRI images.
Visit the Nobel Prizeweb site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nobel_2) to play an interactive game that demonstrates the use of this technology and compares it with other types of imaging technologies.
Also, the results from an MRI session are compared with images obtained from X-ray or computed tomography.
How do the imaging techniques shown in this game indicate the separation of white and gray matter compared with the freshly dissected tissue shown earlier?

The CNS and the PNS both contribute to the same functions, but those functions can be attributed to different regions of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus) or to different ganglia in the periphery.
The problem withtryingtofitfunctionaldifferencesintoanatomicaldivisionsisthatsometimesthesamestructurecanbepartofseveral functions.
For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the retina that are either used for the conscious perception of visual stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the reflexive responses of smooth muscle tissue that are processed through the hypothalamus.
Therearetwowaystoconsiderhowthenervoussystemisdividedfunctionally.First,thebasicfunctionsofthenervous system are sensation, integration, and response.
Secondly, control of the body can be somatic or autonomic‚Äîdivisions that arelargelydefinedbythestructuresthatareinvolvedintheresponse.Thereisalsoaregionoftheperipheralnervoussystem that is called the enteric nervous system that is responsible for a specific set of the functions within the realm of autonomic control related to gastrointestinal functions.
Basic Functions The nervous system is involved in receiving information about the environment around us (sensation) and generating responses to that information (motor responses).
The nervous system can be divided into regions that are responsible forsensation (sensory functions) and for the response (motor functions).
But there is a third function that needs to be included.
Sensory input needs to be integrated with other sensations, as well as with memories, emotional state, or learning (cognition).
Some regions of the nervous system are termed integration or association areas.
The process of integration combines sensory perceptions and higher cognitive functions such as memories, learning, and emotion to produce a response.
Thefirstmajorfunctionofthenervoussystemissensation‚Äîreceivinginformationabouttheenvironmentto gaininputaboutwhatishappeningoutsidethebody(or,sometimes,withinthebody).Thesensoryfunctionsofthenervous system register the presence of a change from homeostasis or a particular event in the environment, known as a stimulus.
The senses we think of most are the ‚Äúbig five‚Äù: taste, smell, touch, sight, and hearing.
The stimuli for taste and smell are both chemical substances (molecules, compounds, ions, etc.
), touch is physical or mechanical stimuli that interact with the skin, sight is light stimuli, and hearing is the perception of sound, which is a physical stimulus similar to some aspects of touch.
There are actually more senses than just those, but that list represents the major senses.
Those five are all senses thatreceivestimulifromtheoutsideworld,andofwhichthereisconsciousperception.Additionalsensorystimulimightbe from the internal environment (inside the body), such as the stretch of an organ wall or the concentration of certain ions in the blood.
The nervous system produces a response on the basis of the stimuli perceived by sensory structures.
An obvious response would be the movement of muscles, such as withdrawing a hand from a hot stove, but there are broader uses of the term.
The nervous system can cause the contraction of all three types of muscle tissue.
For example, skeletal muscle contracts to move the skeleton, cardiac muscle is influenced as heart rate increases during exercise, and smooth muscle contracts as the digestive system moves food along the digestive tract.
Responses also include the neural control of glands in the body as well, such as the production and secretion of sweat by the eccrine and merocrine sweat glands found in the skin to lower body temperature.
Responses can be divided into those that are voluntary or conscious (contraction of skeletal muscle) and those that are involuntary (contraction of smooth muscles, regulation of cardiac muscle, activation of glands).
Voluntary responses are governed by the somatic nervous system and involuntary responses are governed by the autonomic nervous system, which are discussed in the next section.
Integration.
Stimuli that are received by sensory structures are communicated to the nervous system where that information is processed.
This is called integration.
Stimuli are compared with, or integrated with, other stimuli, memories of previous stimuli, or the state of a person at a particular time.
This leads to the specific response that will be generated.

Maybe the count is three balls and one strike, and the batter wants to let this pitch go by in the hope of getting a walk to first base.
Or maybe the batter‚Äôs team is so far ahead, it would be fun to just swing away.
Controlling the Body The nervous system can be divided into two parts mostly on the basis of a functional difference in responses.
The somatic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for conscious perception and voluntary motor responses.
Voluntary motor response meansthecontractionofskeletalmuscle,butthosecontractionsarenotalwaysvoluntaryinthesensethatyouhavetowant to perform them.
Some somatic motor responses are reflexes, and often happen without a conscious decision to perform them.

Theautonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for involuntary control of the body, usually for the sake of homeostasis(regulationoftheinternalenvironment).Sensoryinputforautonomicfunctionscanbefromsensorystructures tuned to external or internal environmental stimuli.
The motor output extends to smooth and cardiac muscle as well as474 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 glandular tissue.
The role of the autonomic system is to regulate the organ systems of the body, which usually means to controlhomeostasis.Sweatglands,forexample,arecontrolledbytheautonomicsystem.Whenyouarehot,sweatinghelps cool your body down.
That is a homeostatic mechanism.
But when you are nervous, you might start sweating also.
That is not homeostatic, it is the physiological response to an emotional state.
There is another division of the nervous system that describes functional responses.
The enteric nervous system (ENS)is responsible for controlling the smooth muscle and glandular tissue in your digestive system.
It is a large part of thePNS,andisnotdependentontheCNS.Itissometimesvalid,however,toconsidertheentericsystemtobeapartofthe autonomic system because the neural structures that make up the enteric system are a component of the autonomic output that regulates digestion.
There are some differences between the two, but for our purposes here there will be a good bit of overlap.
See Figure 12.6 for examples of where these divisions of the nervous system can be found.
Figure 12.6 Somatic, Autonomic, and Enteric Structures of the Nervous System Somatic structures include the spinal nerves, both motor and sensory fibers, as well as the sensory ganglia (posterior root ganglia and cranial nerve ganglia).
Autonomic structures are found in the nerves also, but include the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia.
The enteric nervous system includes the nervous tissue within the organs of the digestive tract.

If you see an ad like that, don‚Äô t click.
It isn‚Äôt true.
An easy way to see how much of the brain a person uses is to take measurements of brain activity while performing a task.
An example of this kind of measurement is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which generates a map of the most active areas and can be generated and presented in three dimensions (Figure 12.7).
This procedure is different from the standard MRI technique because it is measuring changes in the tissue in time with an experimental condition or event.
Figure 12.7 fMRI This fMRI shows activation of the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli.
(credit: ‚ÄúSuperborsuk‚Äù/Wikimedia Commons) The underlying assumption is that active nervous tissue will have greater blood flow.

In this task, visual sensory areas would be active, integrating areas would be active, motor areas responsible for moving the eyes would be active, and motor areas for pressing the button with a finger would be active.
Those areas are distributed all around the brain and the fMRI images would show activity in more than just 10 percent of the brain (someevidencesuggeststhatabout80percentofthebrainisusingenergy‚Äîbasedonbloodflowtothetissue‚Äîduring well-defined tasks similar to the one suggested above).
This task does not even include all of the functions the brain performs.
There is no language response, the body is mostly lying still in the MRI machine, and it does not consider the autonomic functions that would be ongoing in the background.476 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 12.2|Nervous Tissue By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the basic structure of a neuron ‚Ä¢Identify the different types of neurons on the basis of polarity ‚Ä¢List the glial cells of the CNS and describe their function ‚Ä¢List the glial cells of the PNS and describe their function Nervous tissue is composed of two types of cells, neurons and glial cells.
Neurons are the primary type of cell that most anyone associates with the nervous system.
They are responsible for the computation and communication that the nervous system provides.
They are electrically active and release chemical signals to target cells.
Glial cells, or glia, are known to playasupportingrolefornervoustissue.Ongoingresearchpursuesanexpandedrolethatglialcellsmightplayinsignaling, but neurons are still considered the basis of this function.
Neurons are important, but without glial support they would not be able to perform their function.
Neurons Neurons are the cells considered to be the basis of nervous tissue.
They are responsible for the electrical signals that communicate information about sensations, and that produce movements in response to those stimuli, along with inducing thought processes within the brain.
An important part of the function of neurons is in their structure, or shape.
The three- dimensional shape of these cells makes the immense numbers of connections within the nervous system possible.
Parts of a Neuron As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma = ‚Äúbody‚Äù).
The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles.
But what makes neurons special is that they have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes.
Neurons are usually described as having one, and only one, axon‚Äîa fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target cells.
That single axon can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells.
It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is communicated to one or more cells.
The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses.
The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body.
Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites, across the cell body, and down the axon.
This gives the neuron a polarity‚Äîmeaning that information flows in this one direction.
Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these parts to one another.
Figure 12.8 Parts of a Neuron The major parts of the neuron are labeled on a multipolar neuron from the CNS.
Where the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as the axon hillock.
This is a tapering of the cell body toward the axon fiber.
Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of limited components calledaxoplasm.Becausetheaxonhillockrepresentsthebeginningoftheaxon,itisalsoreferredtoasthe initialsegment.
Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells.
Myelin acts as insulation much like the plastic or rubber that is used to insulate electrical wires.
A key difference between myelin and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon.
Each gap is called a node of Ranvier and is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon.
The length of the axon between each gap, which isCHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 477 wrapped in myelin,is referred to as an axon segment.
At the end of the axon is the axon terminal, where there are usually several branches extending toward the target cell, each of which ends in an enlargement called a synaptic end bulb .
These bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the synapse.

They are the focus of intense research because failures in physiology can lead to devastating illnesses.
Why are neurons only found in animals?
Based on what this article says about neuron function, why wouldn't they be helpful for plants or microor ganisms?
Types of Neurons There are many neurons in the nervous system‚Äîa number in the trillions.
And there are many different types of neurons.
They can be classified by many different criteria.
The first way to classify them is by the number of processes attached to the cell body.
Using the standard model of neurons, one of these processes is the axon, and the rest are dendrites.
Because information flows through the neuron from dendrites or cell bodies toward the axon, these names are based on the neuron's polarity (Figure 12.9 ).
Figure 12.9 Neuron Classification by Shape Unipolar cells have one process that includes both the axon and dendrite.
Bipolar cells have two processes, the axon and a dendrite.
Multipolar cells have more than two processes, the axon and two or more dendrites.
Unipolar cells have only one process emerging from the cell.
True unipolar cells are only found in invertebrate animals, so the unipolar cells in humans are more appropriately called ‚Äúpseudo-unipolar‚Äù cells.
Invertebrate unipolar cells do not have dendrites.
Human unipolar cells have an axon that emerges from the cell body, but it splits so that the axon can extend along a very long distance.
At one end of the axon are dendrites, and at the other end, the axon forms synapticconnectionswithatarget.Unipolarcellsareexclusivelysensoryneuronsandhavetwouniquecharacteristics.First, their dendrites are receiving sensory information, sometimes directly from the stimulus itself.
Secondly, the cell bodies of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia.

Bipolar cells are not very common.
They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium (where smell stimuli are sensed), and as part of the retina.
Multipolar neurons are all of the neurons that are not unipolar or bipolar.
They have one axon and two or more dendrites(usuallymanymore).Withtheexceptionoftheunipolarsensoryganglioncells,andthetwospecificbipolarcells mentioned above, all other neurons are multipolar.
Some cutting edge research suggests that certain neurons in the CNS do not conform to the standard model of ‚Äúone, and only one‚Äù axon.
Some sources describe a fourth type of neuron, called an anaxonic neuron.
The name suggests that it has no axon (an- = ‚Äúwithout‚Äù), but this is not accurate.
Anaxonic neurons are very small, and if you look through a microscope at the standard resolution used in histology (approximately 400X to 1000X total magnification), you will not be able to distinguish any process specifically as an axon or a dendrite.
Any of those processes can function as an axon depending on the conditions at any given time.
Nevertheless, even if they cannot be easily seen, and one specific process is definitively the axon, these neurons have multiple processes and are therefore multipolar.
Neurons can also be classified on the basis of where they are found, who found them, what they do, or even what chemicals they use to communicate with each other.
Some neurons referred to in this section on the nervous system are named on the basis of those sorts of classifications (Figure 12.10).
For example, a multipolar neuron that has a very important role to play in a part of the brain called the cerebellum is known as a Purkinje (commonly pronounced per-KIN- gee) cell.
It is named after the anatomist who discovered it (Jan Evangilista Purkinje, 1787‚Äì1869).
Figure 12.10 Other Neuron Classifications Three examples of neurons that are classified on the basis of other criteria.
(a) The pyramidal cell is a multipolar cell with a cell body that is shaped something like a pyramid.
(b) The Purkinje cell in the cerebellum was named after the scientist who originally described it.
(c) Olfactory neurons are named for the functional group with which they belong.
Glial Cells Glial cells, or neuroglia or simply glia, are the other type of cell found in nervous tissue.
They are considered to be supporting cells, and many functions are directedat helping neurons completetheir function for communication.The name glia comes from the Greek word that means ‚Äúglue,‚Äù and was coined by the German pathologist Rudolph Virchow, who wrote in 1856: ‚ÄúThis connective substance, which is in the brain, the spinal cord, and the special sense nerves, is a kind of glue (neuroglia) in which the nervous elements are planted.‚Äù Today, research into nervous tissue has shown that there are many deeper roles that these cells play.
And research may find much more about them in the future.

Astrocytes have many processes extending from their main cell body (not axons or dendrites like neurons, just cell extensions).
Those processes extend to interact with neurons, blood vessels, or the connective tissue covering the CNS that is called the pia mater (Figure 12.11).
Generally, they are supporting cells for the neurons in the central nervous system.
Some ways in which they support neurons in the central nervous system are by maintaining the concentration of chemicals in the extracellular space, removing excess signaling molecules, reacting to tissue damage, and contributing to the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
The blood-brain barrier is a physiological barrier that keeps many substancesthatcirculateintherestofthebodyfromgettingintothecentralnervoussystem,restrictingwhatcancrossfrom circulating blood into the CNS.
Nutrient molecules, such as glucose or amino acids, can pass through the BBB, but other molecules cannot.
This actually causes problems with drug delivery to the CNS.
Pharmaceutical companies are challenged to design drugs that can cross the BBB as well as have an effect on the nervous system.
Figure 12.11 Glial Cells of the CNS The CNS has astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells that support the neurons of the CNS in several ways.
Like a few other parts of the body, the brain has a privileged blood supply.
Very little can pass through by diffusion.
Most substances that cross the wall of a blood vessel into the CNS must do so through an active transport process.
Because ofthis,onlyspecifictypesofmoleculescanentertheCNS.Glucose‚Äîtheprimaryenergysource‚Äîisallowed,asareamino acids.Waterandsomeothersmallparticles,likegasesandions,canenter.Butmosteverythingelsecannot,includingwhite blood cells, which are one of the body‚Äôs main lines of defense.
While this barrier protects the CNS from exposure to toxic or pathogenic substances, it also keeps out the cells that could protect the brain and spinal cord from disease and damage.
The BBB also makes it harder for pharmaceuticals to be developed that can affect the nervous system.
Aside from finding efficacious substances, the means of delivery is also crucial.
Also found in CNS tissue is the oligodendrocyte , sometimes called just ‚Äúoligo,‚Äù which is the glial cell type that insulates axons in the CNS.
The name means ‚Äúcell of a few branches‚Äù (oligo- = ‚Äúfew‚Äù; dendro- = ‚Äúbranches‚Äù; -cyte = ‚Äúcell‚Äù).
There are a few processes that extend from the cell body.
Each one reaches out and surrounds an axon to insulate it inmyelin.Oneoligodendrocytewillprovidethemyelinformultipleaxonsegments,eitherforthesameaxonorforseparate axons.
The function of myelin will be discussed below.480 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Microglia are, as the name implies, smaller than most of the other glial cells.
Ongoing research into these cells, although not entirely conclusive, suggests that they may originate as white blood cells, called macrophages, that become part of the CNS during early development.
While their origin is not conclusively determined, their function is related to what macrophages do in the rest of the body.
When macrophages encounter diseased or damaged cells in the rest of the body, they ingest and digest those cells or the pathogens that cause disease.
Microglia are the cells in the CNS that can do this in normal, healthy tissue, and they are therefore also referred to as CNS-resident macrophages.
Theependymalcell isaglialcellthatfiltersbloodtomake cerebrospinalfluid(CSF),thefluidthatcirculatesthrough the CNS.
Because of the privileged blood supply inherent in the BBB, the extracellular space in nervous tissue does not easily exchange components with the blood.
Ependymal cells line each ventricle, one of four central cavities that are remnantsofthehollowcenteroftheneuraltubeformedduringtheembryonicdevelopmentofthebrain.The choroidplexus is a specialized structure in the ventricles where ependymal cells come in contact with blood vessels and filter and absorb componentsofthebloodtoproducecerebrospinalfluid.Becauseofthis,ependymalcellscanbeconsideredacomponentof theBBB,oraplacewheretheBBBbreaksdown.Theseglialcellsappearsimilartoepithelialcells,makingasinglelayerof cells with little intracellular space and tight connections between adjacent cells.
They also have cilia on their apical surface to help move the CSF through the ventricular space.
The relationship of these glial cells to the structure of the CNS is seen inFigure 12.11.
Glial Cells of the PNS One of the two types of glial cells found in the PNS is the satellite cell.
Satellite cells are found in sensory and autonomic ganglia, where they surround the cell bodies of neurons.
This accounts for the name, based on their appearance under the microscope.
They provide support, performing similar functions in the periphery as astrocytes do in the CNS‚Äîexcept, of course, for establishing the BBB.
The second type of glial cell is the Schwann cell , which insulate axons with myelin in the periphery.
Schwann cells aredifferentthanoligodendrocytes,inthataSchwanncellwrapsaroundaportionofonlyoneaxonsegmentandnoothers.
Oligodendrocytes have processes that reach out to multiple axon segments, whereas the entire Schwann cell surrounds just one axon segment.
The nucleus and cytoplasm of the Schwann cell are on the edge of the myelin sheath.
The relationship of these two types of glial cells to ganglia and nerves in the PNS is seen in Figure 12.12 .
Figure 12.12 Glial Cells of the PNS The PNS has satellite cells and Schwann cells.
Myelin The insulation for axons in the nervous system is provided by glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and Schwann cells in the PNS.
Whereas the manner in which either cell is associated with the axon segment, or segments, that it insulates is different, the means of myelinating an axon segment is mostly the same in the two situations.
Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that surrounds the axon and by doing so creates a myelin sheath that facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along the axon.
The lipids are essentially the phospholipids of the glial cell membrane.
Myelin, however, is more than just the membrane of the glial cell.
It also includes important proteins that are integral to that membrane.
Some of the proteins help to hold the layers of the glial cell membrane closely together.
The appearance of the myelin sheath can be thought of as similar to the pastry wrapped around a hot dog for ‚Äúpigs in ablanket‚Äùorasimilarfood.Theglialcelliswrappedaroundtheaxonseveraltimeswithlittletonocytoplasmbetweenthe glial cell layers.
For oligodendrocytes, the rest of the cell is separate from the myelin sheath as a cell process extends back toward the cell body.
A few other processes provide the same insulation for other axon segments in the area.
For Schwann cells, the outermost layer of the cell membrane contains cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell as a bulge on one side of the myelinsheath.Duringdevelopment,theglialcellislooselyorincompletelywrappedaroundtheaxon(Figure12.13a).TheCHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 481 edgesofthislooseenclosureextendtowardeachother,andoneendtucksundertheother.Theinneredgewrapsaroundthe axon, creating several layers, and the other edge closes around the outside so that the axon is completely enclosed.

Outside the plasma membrane of the axon is the myelin sheath, which is composed of the tightly wrapped plasma membrane of a Schwann cell.
What aspects of the cells in this image react with the stain to make them a deep, dark, black color, such as the multiple layers that are the myelin sheath?
Myelin sheaths can extend for one or two millimeters, depending on the diameter of the axon.
Axon diameters can be as small as 1 to 20 micrometers.
Because a micrometer is 1/1000 of a millimeter, this means that the length of a myelin sheath can be 100‚Äì1000 times the diameter of the axon.
Figure 12.8 ,Figure 12.11 , andFigure 12.12 show the myelin sheath surrounding an axon segment, but are not to scale.
If the myelin sheath were drawn to scale, the neuron would have to be immense‚Äîpossibly covering an entire wall of the room in which you are sitting.482 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 12.13 The Process of Myelination Myelinating glia wrap several layers of cell membrane around the cell membrane of an axon segment.

Though the causes are varied, the results are largely similar.
The myelin insulation of axons is compromised, making electrical signaling slower.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one such disease.
It is an example of an autoimmune disease.
The antibodies produced by lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) mark myelin as something that should not be in the body.
This causes inflammation and the destruction of the myelin in the central nervous system.
As the insulation around the axons is destroyedbythedisease,scarringbecomesobvious.Thisiswherethenameofthediseasecomesfrom;sclerosismeans hardening of tissue, which is what a scar is.
Multiple scars are found in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.
The symptoms of MS include both somatic and autonomic deficits.

12.3|The Function of Nervous Tissue By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Distinguish the major functions of the nervous system: sensation, integration, and response ‚Ä¢List the sequence of events in a simple sensory receptor‚Äìmotor response pathway Having looked at the components of nervous tissue, and the basic anatomy of the nervous system, next comes an understandingofhownervoustissueiscapableofcommunicatingwithinthenervoussystem.Beforegettingtothenutsand boltsofhowthisworks,anillustrationofhowthecomponentscometogetherwillbehelpful.Anexampleissummarizedin Figure 12.14 .484 CHAPTER 12 | THE NER VOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 12.14 Testing the Water (1) The sensory neuron has endings in the skin that sense a stimulus such as water temperature.
The strength of the signal that starts here is dependent on the strength of the stimulus.
(2) The graded potential from the sensory endings, if strong enough, will initiate an action potential at the initial segment of the axon (which is immediately adjacent to the sensory endings in the skin).
(3) The axon of the peripheral sensory neuron enters the spinal cord and contacts another neuron in the gray matter.
The contact is a synapse where another graded potential is caused by the release of a chemical signal from the axon terminals.
(4) An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of this neuron and travels up the sensory pathway to a region of the brain called the thalamus.
Another synapse passes the information along to the next neuron.
(5) The sensory pathway ends when the signal reaches the cerebral cortex.
(6) After integration with neurons in other parts of the cerebral cortex, a motor command is sent from the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex.
(7) The upper motor neuron sends an action potential down to the spinal cord.
The target of the upper motor neuron is the dendrites of the lower motor neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord.
(8) The axon of the lower motor neuron emerges from the spinal cord in a nerve and connects to a muscle through a neuromuscular junction to cause contraction of the target muscle.
Imagine you are about to take a shower in the morning before going to school.
You have turned on the faucet to start the water as you prepare to get in the shower.
After a few minutes, you expect the water to be a temperature that will be comfortable to enter.
So you put your hand out into the spray of water.
What happens next depends on how your nervous system interacts with the stimulus of the water temperature and what you do in response to that stimulus.
Found in the skin of your fingers or toes is a type of sensory receptor that is sensitive to temperature, called a thermoreceptor .
When you place your hand under the shower (Figure 12.15), the cell membrane of the thermoreceptors changes its electrical state (voltage).
The amount of change is dependent on the strength of the stimulus (how hot the water is).
This is called a graded potential.
If the stimulus is strong, the voltage of the cell membrane will change enough to generate an electrical signal that will travel down the axon.
You have learned about this type of signaling before, with respect to the interaction of nerves and muscles at the neuromuscular junction.
The voltage at which such a signal is generated is called the threshold, and the resulting electrical signal is called an action potential.
In this example, the actionpotentialtravels‚Äîaprocessknownas propagation‚Äîalongtheaxonfromtheaxonhillocktotheaxonterminalsand into the synaptic end bulbs.
When this signal reaches the end bulbs, it causes the release of a signaling molecule called a neurotransmitter.CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 485 Figure 12.15 The Sensory Input Receptors in the skin sense the temperature of the water.
The neurotransmitter diffuses across the short distance of the synapse and binds to a receptor protein of the target neuron.
When the molecular signal binds to the receptor, the cell membrane of the target neuron changes its electrical state andanewgradedpotentialbegins.Ifthatgradedpotentialisstrongenoughtoreachthreshold,thesecondneurongenerates an action potential at its axon hillock.
The target of this neuron is another neuron in the thalamus of the brain, the part of the CNS that acts as a relay for sensory information.
At another synapse, neurotransmitter is released and binds to its receptor.
The thalamus then sends the sensory information to the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of gray matter in the brain, where conscious perception of that water temperature begins.
Within the cerebral cortex, information is processed among many neurons, integrating the stimulus of the water temperature with other sensory stimuli, with your emotional state (you just aren't ready to wake up; the bed is calling to you), memories (perhaps of the lab notes you have to study before a quiz).
Finally, a plan is developed about what to do, whether that is to turn the temperature up, turn the whole shower off and go back to bed, or step into the shower.
To do any of these things, the cerebral cortex has to send a command out to your body to move muscles ( Figure 12.16 ).
Figure 12.16 The Motor Response On the basis of the sensory input and the integration in the CNS, a motor response is formulated and executed.
A region of the cortex is specialized for sending signals down to the spinal cord for movement.
The upper motor neuronis in this region, called the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex, which has an axon that extends all the way down the spinal cord.
At the level of the spinal cord at which this axon makes a synapse, a graded potential occurs in the cell membrane of a lower motor neuron.
This second motor neuron is responsible for causing muscle fibers to contract.
In the manner described in the chapter on muscle tissue, an action potential travels along the motor neuron axon into the periphery.Theaxonterminatesonmusclefibersattheneuromuscularjunction.Acetylcholineisreleasedatthisspecialized synapse, which causes the muscle action potential to begin, following a large potential known as an end plate potential.

12.4|The Action Potential By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the components of the membrane that establish the resting membrane potential ‚Ä¢Describe the changes that occur to the membrane that result in the action potential The functions of the nervous system‚Äîsensation, integration, and response‚Äîdepend on the functions of the neurons underlying these pathways.
To understand how neurons are able to communicate, it is necessary to describe the role of anexcitable membrane in generating these signals.
The basis of this communication is the action potential, which demonstrateshowchangesinthemembranecanconstituteasignal.Lookingatthewaythesesignalsworkinmorevariable circumstances involves a look at graded potentials, which will be covered in the next section.
Electrically Active Cell Membranes Most cells in the body make use of charged particles, ions, to build up a charge across the cell membrane.
Previously, this was shown to be a part of how muscle cells work.
For skeletal muscles to contract, based on excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling,requiresinputfromaneuron.Bothofthecellsmakeuseofthecellmembranetoregulateionmovementbetween the extracellular fluid and cytosol.
As you learned in the chapter on cells, the cell membrane is primarily responsible for regulating what can cross the membrane and what stays on only one side.
The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer, so only substances that can pass directly through the hydrophobic core can diffuse through unaided.
Charged particles, which are hydrophilic by definition, cannot pass through the cell membrane without assistance (Figure 12.17).
Transmembrane proteins, specifically channel proteins, make this possible.
Several channels, as well as specialized energy dependent ‚Äúion-pumps,‚Äù are necessary to generateatransmembranepotentialandtogenerateanactionpotential.Ofspecialinterestisthecarrierproteinreferredtoas the sodium/potassium pump that moves sodium ions (Na+) out of a cell and potassium ions (K+) into a cell, thus regulating ion concentration on both sides of the cell membrane.CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 487 Figure 12.17 Cell Membrane and Transmembrane Proteins The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer and has many transmembrane proteins, including different types of channel proteins that serve as ion channels.
The sodium/potassium pump requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), so it is also referred to as an ATPase.
As was explained in the cell chapter, the concentration of Na+is higher outside the cell than inside, and the concentrationofK+ishigherinsidethecellishigherthanoutside.Thatmeansthatthispumpismovingtheionsagainstthe concentration gradients for sodium and potassium, which is why it requires energy.
In fact, the pump basically maintains those concentration gradients.
Ion channels are pores that allow specific charged particles to cross the membrane in response to an existing concentration gradient.
Proteins are capable of spanning the cell membrane, including its hydrophobic core, and can interact with the charge of ions because of the varied properties of amino acids found within specific domains or regions of the protein channel.
Hydrophobic amino acids are found in the domains that are apposed to the hydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids.
Hydrophilic amino acids are exposed to the fluid environments of the extracellular fluid and cytosol.
Additionally, the ions will interact with the hydrophilic amino acids, which will be selective for the charge of the ion.
Channelsforcations(positiveions)willhavenegativelychargedsidechainsinthepore.Channelsforanions(negativeions) will have positively charged side chains in the pore.
This is called electrochemical exclusion, meaning that the channel pore is charge-specific.
Ions can also be specified by the diameter of the pore.
The distance between the amino acids will be specific for the diameter of the ion when it dissociates from the water molecules surrounding it.
Because of the surrounding water molecules, larger pores are not ideal for smaller ions because the water molecules will interact, by hydrogen bonds, more readily than the amino acid side chains.
This is called size exclusion .
Some ion channels are selective for charge but not necessarilyforsize,andthusarecalleda nonspecificchannel.Thesenonspecificchannelsallowcations‚ÄîparticularlyNa+, K+, and Ca2+‚Äîto cross the membrane, but exclude anions.
Ion channels do not always freely allow ions to diffuse across the membrane.
They are opened by certain events, meaning the channels are gated.
So another way that channels can be categorized is on the basis of how they are gated.
Although these classes of ion channels are found primarily in cells of nervous or muscular tissue, they also can be found in cells of epithelial and connective tissues.
Aligand-gatedchannel opensbecauseasignalingmolecule,aligand,bindstotheextracellularregionofthechannel.
This type of channel is also known as an ionotropic receptor because when the ligand, known as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system, binds to the protein, ions cross the membrane changing its char ge (Figure 12.18 ).488 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 12.18 Ligand-Gated Channels When the ligand, in this case the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, binds to a specific location on the extracellular surface of the channel protein, the pore opens to allow select ions through.
The ions, in this case, are cations of sodium, calcium, and potassium.
Amechanicallygatedchannel opensbecauseofaphysicaldistortionofthecellmembrane.Manychannelsassociated with the sense of touch (somatosensation) are mechanically gated.
For example, as pressure is applied to the skin, these channels open and allow ions to enter the cell.
Similar to this type of channel would be the channel that opens on the basis of temperature changes, as in testing the water in the shower ( Figure 12.19 ).
Figure 12.19 Mechanically Gated Channels When a mechanical change occurs in the surrounding tissue, such as pressure or touch, the channel is physically opened.
Thermoreceptors work on a similar principle.
When the local tissue temperature changes, the protein reacts by physically opening the channel.
Avoltage-gated channel is a channel that responds to changes in the electrical properties of the membrane in which it is embedded.
Normally, the inner portion of the membrane is at a negative voltage.
When that voltage becomes less negative, the channel begins to allow ions to cross the membrane ( Figure 12.20 ).CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 489 Figure 12.20 Voltage-Gated Channels Voltage-gated channels open when the transmembrane voltage changes around them.
Amino acids in the structure of the protein are sensitive to charge and cause the pore to open to the selected ion.
Aleakage channel is randomly gated, meaning that it opens and closes at random, hence the reference to leaking.
There is no actual event that opens the channel; instead, it has an intrinsic rate of switching between the open and closed states.
Leakage channels contribute to the resting transmembrane voltage of the excitable membrane ( Figure 12.21 ).
Figure 12.21 Leakage Channels In certain situations, ions need to move across the membrane randomly.
The particular electrical properties of certain cells are modified by the presence of this type of channel.
The Membrane Potential The electrical state of the cell membrane can have several variations.
These are all variations in the membrane potential.
A potential is a distribution of charge across the cell membrane, measured in millivolts (mV).
The standard is to compare theinsideofthecellrelativetotheoutside,sothemembranepotentialisavaluerepresentingthechargeontheintracellular side of the membrane based on the outside being zero, relatively speaking ( Figure 12.22 ).490 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 12.22 Measuring Charge across a Membrane with a Voltmeter A recording electrode is inserted into the cell and a reference electrode is outside the cell.
By comparing the charge measured by these two electrodes, the transmembrane voltage is determined.
It is conventional to express that value for the cytosol relative to the outside.
The concentration of ions in extracellular and intracellular fluids is largely balanced, with a net neutral charge.
However, a slight difference in charge occurs right at the membrane surface, both internally and externally.
It is the difference in this very limited region that has all the power in neurons (and muscle cells) to generate electrical signals, including action potentials.
Before these electrical signals can be described, the resting state of the membrane must be explained.
When the cell is at rest, and the ion channels are closed (except for leakage channels which randomly open), ions are distributed across the membrane in a very predictable way.
The concentration of Na+outside the cell is 10 times greater than the concentration inside.
Also, the concentration of K+inside the cell is greater than outside.
The cytosol contains a high concentration of anions, in the form of phosphate ions and negatively charged proteins.
Large anions are a component of the inner cell membrane, including specialized phospholipids and proteins associated with the inner leaflet of the membrane (leaflet is a term used for one side of the lipid bilayer membrane).
The negative char ge is localized in the large anions.
With the ions distributed across the membrane at these concentrations, the difference in charge is measured at -70 mV, the value described as the resting membrane potential .
The exact value measured for the resting membrane potential varies between cells, but -70 mV is most commonly used as this value.
This voltage would actually be much lower except forthecontributionsofsomeimportantproteinsinthemembrane.LeakagechannelsallowNa+toslowlymoveintothecell orK+toslowlymoveout,andtheNa+/K+pumprestoresthem.Thismayappeartobeawasteofenergy,buteachhasarole in maintaining the membrane potential.

This is known as depolarization, meaning the membrane potential moves toward zero.
TheconcentrationgradientforNa+issostrongthatitwillcontinuetoenterthecellevenafterthemembranepotential has become zero, so that the voltage immediately around the pore begins to become positive.
The electrical gradient also plays a role, as negative proteins below the membrane attract the sodium ion.
The membrane potential will reach +30 mV by the time sodium has entered the cell.
As the membrane potential reaches +30 mV, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane.
These channels are specific for the potassium ion.
A concentration gradient acts on K+, as well.
As K+starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage.
This is calledrepolarization , meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting membrane potential.
Repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value.
Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a period ofCHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 491 hyperpolarizationoccurswhiletheK+channelsareopen.ThoseK+channelsareslightlydelayedinclosing,accountingfor this short overshoot.

That can also be written as a 0.1-V change.
To putthatvalueinperspective,thinkaboutabattery.AnAAbatterythatyoumightfindinatelevisionremotehasavoltageof 1.5 V, or a 9-V battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 V. The change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries.
In fact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery.
A charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions.
A battery in your remote has stored a charge that is ‚Äúreleased‚Äù when you push a button.
Figure 12.23 Graph of Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the action potential begins with depolarization, followed by repolarization, which goes past the resting potential into hyperpolarization, and finally the membrane returns to rest.
What happens across the membrane of an electrically active cell is a dynamic process that is hard to visualize with static images or through text descriptions.
View this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/dynamic1) to learn more about this process.
What is the difference between the driving force for Na+and K+?
And what is similar about the movement of these two ions?
The question is, now, what initiates the action potential?
The description above conveniently glosses over that point.
But it is vital to understanding what is happening.
The membrane potential will stay at the resting voltage until something changes.
The description above just says that a Na+channel opens.
Now, to say ‚Äúa channel opens‚Äù does not mean that one individualtransmembraneproteinchanges.Instead,itmeansthatonekindofchannelopens.Thereareafewdifferenttypes of channels that allow Na+to cross the membrane.
A ligand-gated Na+channel will open when a neurotransmitter binds to it and a mechanically gated Na+channel will open when a physical stimulus affects a sensory receptor (like pressure appliedtotheskincompressesatouchreceptor).Whetheritisaneurotransmitterbindingtoitsreceptorproteinorasensory stimulus activating a sensory receptor cell, some stimulus gets the process started.
Sodium starts to enter the cell and the membrane becomes less negative.
A third type of channel that is an important part of depolarization in the action potential is the voltage-gated Na+ channel.
The channels that start depolarizing the membrane because of a stimulus help the cell to depolarize from -70 mV492 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 to -55 mV.
Once the membrane reaches that voltage, the voltage-gated Na+channels open.
This is what is known as the threshold.
Any depolarization that does not change the membrane potential to -55 mV or higher will not reach threshold and thus will not result in an action potential.
Also, any stimulus that depolarizes the membrane to -55 mV or beyond will cause a large number of channels to open and an action potential will be initiated.
Because of the threshold, the action potential can be likened to a digital event‚Äîit either happens or it does not.
If the threshold is not reached, then no action potential occurs.
If depolarization reaches -55 mV, then the action potential continues and runs all the way to +30 mV, at which K+causes repolarization, including the hyperpolarizing overshoot.
Also,thosechangesarethesameforeveryactionpotential,whichmeansthatoncethethresholdisreached,theexactsame thing happens.
A stronger stimulus, which might depolarize the membrane well past threshold, will not make a ‚Äúbigger‚Äù action potential.
Action potentials are ‚Äúall or none.‚Äù Either the membrane reaches the threshold and everything occurs as described above, or the membrane does not reach the threshold and nothing else happens.
All action potentials peak at the same voltage (+30 mV), so one action potential is not bigger than another.
Stronger stimuli will initiate multiple action potentialsmorequickly,buttheindividualsignalsarenotbigger.Thus,forexample,youwillnotfeelagreatersensationof pain, or have a stronger muscle contraction, because of the size of the action potential because they are not dif ferent sizes.
As we have seen, the depolarization and repolarization of an action potential are dependent on two types of channels (the voltage-gated Na+channel and the voltage-gated K+channel).
The voltage-gated Na+channel actually has two gates.
One is the activation gate, which opens when the membrane potential crosses -55 mV.
The other gate is the inactivation gate, which closes after a specific period of time‚Äîon the order of a fraction of a millisecond.
When a cell is at rest, the activationgateisclosedandtheinactivationgateisopen.However,whenthethresholdisreached,theactivationgateopens, allowingNa+torushintothecell.Timedwiththepeakofdepolarization,theinactivationgatecloses.Duringrepolarization, no more sodium can enter the cell.
When the membrane potential passes -55 mV again, the activation gate closes.
After that, the inactivation gate re-opens, making the channel ready to start the whole process over again.
Thevoltage-gatedK+channelhasonlyonegate,whichissensitivetoamembranevoltageof-50mV.However,itdoes not open as quickly as the voltage-gated Na+channel does.
It might take a fraction of a millisecond for the channel to open oncethatvoltagehasbeenreached.ThetimingofthiscoincidesexactlywithwhentheNa+flowpeaks,sovoltage-gatedK+ channels open just as the voltage-gated Na+channels are being inactivated.
As the membrane potential repolarizes and the voltagepasses-50mVagain,thechannelcloses‚Äîagain,withalittledelay.Potassiumcontinuestoleavethecellforashort while and the membrane potential becomes more negative, resulting in the hyperpolarizing overshoot.
Then the channel closesagainandthemembranecanreturntotherestingpotentialbecauseoftheongoingactivityofthenon-gatedchannels and the Na+/K+pump.
All of this takes place within approximately 2 milliseconds (Figure 12.24).
While an action potential is in progress, another one cannot be initiated.
That effect is referred to as the refractory period .
There are two phases of the refractory period: the absolute refractory period and therelative refractory period .
During the absolute phase, another action potential will not start.
This is because of the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated Na+channel.
Once that channel is back to its resting conformation (less than -55 mV), a new action potential could be started, but only by a stronger stimulus than theonethatinitiatedthecurrentactionpotential.ThisisbecauseoftheflowofK+outofthecell.Becausethationisrushing out, any Na+that tries to enter will not depolarize the cell, but will only keep the cell from hyperpolarizing.
Figure 12.24 Stages of an Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the events of the action potential can be related to specific changes in the membrane voltage.
(1) At rest, the membrane voltage is -70 mV.
(2) The membrane begins to depolarize when an external stimulus is applied.
(3) The membrane voltage begins a rapid rise toward +30 mV.
(4) The membrane voltage starts to return to a negative value.
(5) Repolarization continues past the resting membrane voltage, resulting in hyperpolarization.
(6) The membrane voltage returns to the resting value shortly after hyperpolarization.CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 493 Propagation of the Action Potential The action potential is initiated at the beginning of the axon, at what is called the initial segment.
There is a high density of voltage-gated Na+channels so that rapid depolarization can take place here.
Going down the length of the axon, the action potential is propagated because more voltage-gated Na+channels are opened as the depolarization spreads.
This spreading occurs because Na+enters through the channel and moves along the inside of the cell membrane.
As the Na+moves, or flows, a short distance along the cell membrane, its positive charge depolarizes a little more of the cell membrane.
As that depolarizationspreads,newvoltage-gatedNa+channelsopenandmoreionsrushintothecell,spreadingthedepolarization a little farther.
Because voltage-gated Na+channels are inactivated at the peak of the depolarization, they cannot be opened again for a brief time‚Äîthe absolute refractory period.
Because of this, depolarization spreading back toward previously opened channelshasnoeffect.Theactionpotentialmustpropagatetowardtheaxonterminals;asaresult,thepolarityoftheneuron is maintained, as mentioned above.
Propagation, as described above, applies to unmyelinated axons.
When myelination is present, the action potential propagates differently.
Sodium ions that enter the cell at the initial segment start to spread along the length of the axon segment, but there are no voltage-gated Na+channels until the first node of Ranvier.
Because there is not constant opening of these channels along the axon segment, the depolarization spreads at an optimal speed.
The distance between nodes is the optimal distance to keep the membrane still depolarized above threshold at the next node.
As Na+spreads along the insideof themembraneof theaxonsegment,thechargestartstodissipate.If thenodewere anyfartherdown theaxon,that depolarization would have fallen off too much for voltage-gated Na+channels to be activated at the next node of Ranvier.
If the nodes were any closer together, the speed of propagation would be slower.
Propagation along an unmyelinated axon is referred to as continuous conduction; along the length of a myelinated axon, it is saltatory conduction.
Continuous conduction is slow because there are always voltage-gated Na+channels opening,andmoreandmoreNa+isrushingintothecell.Saltatoryconductionisfasterbecausetheactionpotentialbasically jumps from one node to the next (saltare = ‚Äúto leap‚Äù), and the new influx of Na+renews the depolarized membrane.
Along withthemyelinationoftheaxon,thediameteroftheaxoncaninfluencethespeedofconduction.Muchaswaterrunsfaster in a wide river than in a narrow creek, Na+-based depolarization spreads faster down a wide axon than down a narrow one.
This concept is known as resistance and is generally true for electrical wires or plumbing, just as it is true for axons, although the specific conditions are different at the scales of electrons or ions versus water in a river.
Potassium Concentration Glial cells, especially astrocytes, are responsible for maintaining the chemical environment of the CNS tissue.
The concentrationsofionsintheextracellularfluidarethebasisforhowthemembranepotentialisestablishedandchanges in electrochemical signaling.
If the balance of ions is upset, drastic outcomes are possible.
Normally the concentration of K+is higher inside the neuron than outside.
After the repolarizing phase of the action potential, K+leakage channels and the Na+/K+pump ensure that the ions return to their original locations.
Followingastrokeorotherischemicevent,extracellularK+levelsareelevated.Theastrocytesintheareaareequipped to clear excess K+to aid the pump.
But when the level is far out of balance, the ef fects can be irreversible.
Astrocytes can become reactive in cases such as these, which impairs their ability to maintain the local chemical environment.
The glial cells enlarge and their processes swell.
They lose their K+buffering ability and the function of thepumpisaffected,orevenreversed.IfaNa+gradientbreaksdown,thishasamoreimportanteffectthaninterrupting the action potential.
Glucose transport into cells is coupled with Na+co-transport.
When that is lost, the cell cannot get the energy it needs.
In the central nervous system, carbohydrate metabolism is the only means of producing ATP.
Elsewhere in the body, cells rely on carbohydrates, lipids, or amino acids to power mitochondrial ATP production.
But the CNS does not store lipids in adipocytes (fat cells) as an energy reserve.
The lipids in the CNS are in the cell membranes of neurons and glial cells, notably as an integral component of myelin.
Proteins in the CNS are crucial to neuronal function, in roles such as channels for electrical signaling or as part of the cytoskeleton.
Those macromolecules are not used to power mitochondrial ATP production in neurons.494 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neurolab) to see a virtual neurophysiology lab, and to observe electrophysiologicalprocesses in the nervous system, where scientists directlymeasure the electricalsignals produced by neurons.
Often, the action potentials occur so rapidly that watching a screen to see them occur is not helpful.
A speaker is powered by the signals recorded from a neuron and it ‚Äúpops‚Äù each time the neuron fires an action potential.
These action potentials are firing so fast that it sounds like static on the radio.
Electrophysiologists can recognize the patterns within that static to understand what is happening.
Why is the leech model used for measuring the electrical activity of neurons instead of using humans?
12.5|Communication Between Neurons By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Explain the differences between the types of graded potentials ‚Ä¢Categorize the major neurotransmitters by chemical type and effect The electrical changes taking place within a neuron, as described in the previous section, are similar to a light switch being turned on.
A stimulus starts the depolarization, but the action potential runs on its own once a threshold has been reached.
The question is now, ‚ÄúWhat flips the light switch on?‚Äù Temporary changes to the cell membrane voltage can result from neurons receiving information from the environment, or from the action of one neuron on another.
These special types of potentials influence a neuron and determine whether an action potential will occur or not.
Many of these transient signals originate at the synapse.
Graded Potentials Local changes in the membrane potential are called graded potentials and are usually associated with the dendrites of a neuron.
The amount of change in the membrane potential is determined by the size of the stimulus that causes it.
In the example of testing the temperature of the shower, slightly warm water would only initiate a small change in a thermoreceptor, whereas hot water would cause a large amount of change in the membrane potential.
Gradedpotentialscanbeoftwosorts,eithertheyaredepolarizingorhyperpolarizing(Figure12.25).Foramembrane at the resting potential, a graded potential represents a change in that voltage either above -70 mV or below -70 mV.
Depolarizing graded potentials are often the result of Na+or Ca2+entering the cell.
Both of these ions have higher concentrations outside the cell than inside; because they have a positive charge, they will move into the cell causing it to become less negative relative to the outside.
Hyperpolarizing graded potentials can be caused by K+leaving the cell or Cl- entering the cell.
If a positive charge moves out of a cell, the cell becomes more negative; if a negative charge enters the cell, the same thing happens.CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 495 Figure 12.25 Graded Potentials Graded potentials are temporary changes in the membrane voltage, the characteristics of which depend on the size of the stimulus.
Some types of stimuli cause depolarization of the membrane, whereas others cause hyperpolarization.
It depends on the specific ion channels that are activated in the cell membrane.
Types of Graded Potentials For the unipolar cells of sensory neurons‚Äîboth those with free nerve endings and those within encapsulations‚Äîgraded potentials develop in the dendrites that influence the generation of an action potential in the axon of the same cell.
This is called a generator potential.
For other sensory receptor cells, such as taste cells or photoreceptors of the retina, graded potentials in their membranes result in the release of neurotransmitters at synapses with sensory neurons.
This is called a receptor potential .
Apostsynaptic potential (PSP) is the graded potential in the dendrites of a neuron that is receiving synapses from other cells.
Postsynaptic potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing.
Depolarization in a postsynaptic potential is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) because it causes the membrane potential to move toward threshold.
Hyperpolarization in a postsynaptic potential is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) because it causes the membrane potential to move away from threshold.
Summation All types of graded potentials will result in small changes of either depolarization or hyperpolarization in the voltage of a membrane.
These changes can lead to the neuron reaching threshold if the changes add together, or summate.
The combined effects of different types of graded potentials are illustrated in Figure 12.26 .
If the total change in voltage in the membrane is a positive 15 mV, meaning that the membrane depolarizes from -70 mV to -55 mV, then the graded potentials will result in the membrane reaching threshold.
For receptor potentials, threshold is not a factor because the change in membrane potential for receptor cells directly causesneurotransmitterrelease.However,generatorpotentialscaninitiateactionpotentialsinthesensoryneuronaxon,and postsynapticpotentialscaninitiateanactionpotentialintheaxonofotherneurons.Gradedpotentialssummateataspecific locationat the beginningof the axon to initiatethe actionpotential,namelythe initialsegment.For sensory neurons, which do not have a cell body between the dendrites and the axon, the initial segment is directly adjacent to the dendritic endings.
For all other neurons, the axon hillock is essentially the initial segment of the axon, and it is where summation takes place.
Theselocationshaveahighdensityofvoltage-gatedNa+channelsthatinitiatethedepolarizingphaseoftheactionpotential.
Summation can be spatial or temporal, meaning it can be the result of multiple graded potentials at different locations on the neuron, or all at the same place but separated in time.
Spatial summation is related to associating the activity of multiple inputs to a neuron with each other.
Temporal summation is the relationship of multiple action potentials from a single cell resulting in a significant change in the membrane potential.
Spatial and temporal summation can act together, as well.496 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 12.26 Postsynaptic Potential Summation The result of summation of postsynaptic potentials is the overall change in the membrane potential.
At point A, several different excitatory postsynaptic potentials add up to a large depolarization.
At point B, a mix of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials result in a different end result for the membrane potential.

The process of converting electricalsignalstochemicalsignalsandbackrequiressubtlechangesthatcanresultintransientincreasesordecreases in membrane voltage.
To cause a lasting change in the target cell, multiple signals are usually added together, or summated.
Does spatial summation have to happen all at once, or can the separate signals arrive on the postsynaptic neuron at slightly different times?
Explain your answer.
Synapses There are two types of connections between electrically active cells, chemical synapses and electrical synapses.
In a chemical synapse , a chemical signal‚Äînamely, a neurotransmitter‚Äîis released from one cell and it affects the other cell.
In anelectrical synapse, there is a direct connection between the two cells so that ions can pass directly from one cell to the next.
If one cell is depolarized in an electrical synapse, the joined cell also depolarizes because the ions pass between the cells.
Chemical synapses involve the transmission of chemical information from one cell to the next.
This section will concentrate on the chemical type of synapse.
An example of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) described in the chapter on muscle tissue.
In the nervous system, there are many more synapses that are essentially the same as the NMJ.
All synapses have common characteristics, which can be summarized in this list: ‚Ä¢presynaptic element ‚Ä¢neurotransmitter (packaged in vesicles) ‚Ä¢synaptic cleft ‚Ä¢receptor proteins ‚Ä¢postsynaptic element ‚Ä¢neurotransmitter elimination or re-uptake For the NMJ, these characteristics are as follows: the presynaptic element is the motor neuron's axon terminals, the neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, the synaptic cleft is the space between the cells where the neurotransmitter diffuses, the receptor protein is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the postsynaptic element is the sarcolemma of the muscle cell, andCHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 497 theneurotransmitteriseliminatedbyacetylcholinesterase.Othersynapsesaresimilartothis,andthespecificsaredifferent, but they all contain the same characteristics.
Neurotransmitter Release When an action potential reaches the axon terminals, voltage-gated Ca2+channels in the membrane of the synaptic end bulb open.
The concentration of Ca2+increases inside the end bulb, and the Ca2+ion associates with proteins in the outer surface of neurotransmitter vesicles.
The Ca2+facilitates the merging of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane so that the neurotransmitter is released through exocytosis into the small gap between the cells, known as the synaptic cleft.
Once in the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter diffuses the short distance to the postsynaptic membrane and can interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Receptors are specific for the neurotransmitter, and the two fit together like a key and lock.
One neurotransmitter binds to its receptor and will not bind to receptors for other neurotransmitters, making the binding a specific chemical event ( Figure 12.27 ).
Figure 12.27 The Synapse The synapse is a connection between a neuron and its target cell (which is not necessarily a neuron).
The presynaptic element is the synaptic end bulb of the axon where Ca2+enters the bulb to cause vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.
The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft to bind to its receptor.
The neurotransmitter is cleared from the synapse either by enzymatic degradation, neuronal reuptake, or glial reuptake.
Neurotransmitter Systems Thereareseveralsystemsofneurotransmittersthatarefoundatvarioussynapsesinthenervoussystem.Thesegroupsrefer to the chemicals that are the neurotransmitters, and within the groups are specific systems.
The first group, which is a neurotransmitter system of its own, is the cholinergic system.
It is the system based on acetylcholine.
This includes the NMJ as an example of a cholinergic synapse, but cholinergic synapses are found in other parts of the nervous system.
They are in the autonomic nervous system, as well as distributed throughout the brain.
The cholinergic system has two types of receptors, the nicotinic receptor is found in the NMJ as well as other synapses.Thereisalsoanacetylcholinereceptorknownasthe muscarinicreceptor .Bothofthesereceptorsarenamedfor drugs that interact with the receptor in addition to acetylcholine.
Nicotine will bind to the nicotinic receptor and activate it similartoacetylcholine.Muscarine,aproductofcertainmushrooms,willbindtothemuscarinicreceptor.However,nicotine will not bind to the muscarinic receptor and muscarine will not bind to the nicotinic receptor .498 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Another group of neurotransmitters are amino acids.
This includes glutamate (Glu), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid, a derivative of glutamate), and glycine (Gly).
These amino acids have an amino group and a carboxyl group in their chemical structures.
Glutamate is one of the 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins.
Each amino acid neurotransmitter would be part of its own system, namely the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic systems.
They each have their own receptors and do not interact with each other.
Amino acid neurotransmitters are eliminated from the synapse by reuptake.
A pump in the cell membrane of the presynaptic element, or sometimes a neighboring glial cell, will clear the amino acid from the synaptic cleft so that it can be recycled, repackaged in vesicles, and released again.
Another class of neurotransmitter is the biogenic amine, a group of neurotransmitters that are enzymatically made from amino acids.
They have amino groups in them, but no longer have carboxyl groups and are therefore no longer classified as amino acids.
Serotonin is made from tryptophan.
It is the basis of the serotonergic system, which has its own specific receptors.
Serotonin is transported back into the presynaptic cell for repackaging.
Other biogenic amines are made from tyrosine, and include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
Dopamine is part of its own system, the dopaminergic system, which has dopamine receptors.
Dopamine is removed from the synapse by transport proteins in the presynaptic cell membrane.
Norepinephrine and epinephrine belong to the adrenergic neurotransmitter system.
The two molecules are very similar and bind to the same receptors, which are referred to as alpha and beta receptors.
Norepinephrine and epinephrine are also transported back into the presynaptic cell.
The chemical epinephrine (epi- = ‚Äúon‚Äù; ‚Äú-nephrine‚Äù = kidney) is also known as adrenaline (renal = ‚Äúkidney‚Äù), and norepinephrine is sometimes referred to as noradrenaline.
The adrenal gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into the blood stream as hormones.
Aneuropeptide is a neurotransmitter molecule made up of chains of amino acids connected by peptide bonds.
This is what a protein is, but the term protein implies a certain length to the molecule.
Some neuropeptides are quite short, such as met-enkephalin, which is five amino acids long.
Others are long, such as beta-endorphin, which is 31 amino acids long.
Neuropeptides are often released at synapses in combination with another neurotransmitter, and they often act as hormones in other systems of the body, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or substance P. The effect of a neurotransmitter on the postsynaptic element is entirely dependent on the receptor protein.
First, if there is no receptor protein in the membrane of the postsynaptic element, then the neurotransmitter has no effect.
The depolarizingorhyperpolarizingeffectisalsodependentonthereceptor.Whenacetylcholinebindstothenicotinicreceptor, the postsynaptic cell is depolarized.
This is because the receptor is a cation channel and positively charged Na+will rush into the cell.
However, when acetylcholine binds to the muscarinic receptor, of which there are several variants, it might cause depolarization or hyperpolarization of the target cell.
The amino acid neurotransmitters, glutamate, glycine, and GABA, are almost exclusively associated with just one effect.
Glutamate is considered an excitatory amino acid, but only because Glu receptors in the adult cause depolarization of the postsynaptic cell.
Glycine and GABA are considered inhibitory amino acids, again because their receptors cause hyperpolarization.
The biogenic amines have mixed effects.
For example, the dopamine receptors that are classified as D1 receptors are excitatory whereas D2-type receptors are inhibitory.
Biogenic amine receptors and neuropeptide receptors can have even more complex effects because some may not directly affect the membrane potential, but rather have an effect on gene transcription or other metabolic processes in the neuron.
The characteristics of the various neurotransmitter systems presented in this section are organized in Table 12.3.
The important thing to remember about neurotransmitters, and signaling chemicals in general, is that the effect is entirely dependent on the receptor.
Neurotransmitters bind to one of two classes of receptors at the cell surface, ionotropic or metabotropic (Figure 12.28).
Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, such as the nicotinic receptor for acetylcholine or the glycine receptor.
A metabotropic receptor involves a complex of proteins that result in metabolic changes within the cell.
The receptor complex includes the transmembrane receptor protein, a G protein, and an effector protein.
The neurotransmitter, referred to as the first messenger, binds to the receptor protein on the extracellular surface of thecell,andtheintracellularsideoftheproteininitiatesactivityoftheGprotein.The Gprotein isaguanosinetriphosphate (GTP) hydrolase that physically moves from the receptor protein to the effector protein to activate the latter.
An effector proteinis an enzyme that catalyzes the generation of a new molecule, which acts as the intracellular mediator of the signal that binds to the receptor.
This intracellular mediator is called the second messenger.
Different receptors use different second messengers.
Two common examples of second messengers are cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and inositol triphosphate (IP 3).
The enzyme adenylate cyclase (an example of an effector protein) makes cAMP, and phospholipase C is the enzyme that makes IP 3.
Second messengers, after they are produced by the effector protein, cause metabolic changes within the cell.
These changes are most likely the activation of other enzymes in the cell.
In neurons, they often modify ion channels, either opening or closing them.
These enzymes can also cause changes in the cell, such as the activation of genes in the nucleus, and therefore the increased synthesis of proteins.
In neurons, these kinds of changes are often the basis of stronger connections between cells at the synapse and may be the basis of learning and memory.CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 499 Figure 12.28 Receptor Types (a) An ionotropic receptor is a channel that opens when the neurotransmitter binds to it.
(b) A metabotropic receptor is a complex that causes metabolic changes in the cell when the neurotransmitter binds to it (1).
After binding, the G protein hydrolyzes GTP and moves to the effector protein (2).
When the G protein contacts the effector protein, a second messenger is generated, such as cAMP (3).
The second messenger can then go on to cause changes in the neuron, such as opening or closing ion channels, metabolic changes, and changes in gene transcription.500 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neurotrans) to learn about the release of a neurotransmitter.
The action potential reaches the end of the axon, called the axon terminal, and a chemical signal is released to tell the target cell to do something‚Äîeither to initiate a new action potential, or to suppress that activity.
In a very short space, the electrical signal of the action potential is changed into the chemical signal of a neurotransmitter and then back to electricalchangesinthetargetcellmembrane.Whatistheimportanceofvoltage-gatedcalciumchannelsintherelease of neurotransmitters?

Table 12.3CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 501 Nervous System The underlying cause of some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs, appears to be related toproteins‚Äîspecifically,toproteinsbehavingbadly.OneofthestrongesttheoriesofwhatcausesAlzheimer‚Äôsdisease is based on the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, dense conglomerations of a protein that is not functioning correctly.
Parkinson‚Äôs disease is linked to an increase in a protein known as alpha-synuclein that is toxic to the cells of the substantia nigra nucleus in the midbrain.
For proteins to function correctly, they are dependent on their three-dimensional shape.
The linear sequence of amino acids folds into a three-dimensional shape that is based on the interactions between and among those amino acids.
When the folding is disturbed, and proteins take on a different shape, they stop functioning correctly.
But the diseaseisnotnecessarilytheresultoffunctionallossoftheseproteins;rather,thesealteredproteinsstarttoaccumulate and may become toxic.
For example, in Alzheimer‚Äôs, the hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of these amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex.
The term coined to describe this sort of disease is ‚Äúproteopathy‚Äù and it includes other diseases.
Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, the human variant of the prion disease known as mad cow disease in the bovine, also involves the accumulation of amyloid plaques, similar to Alzheimer‚Äôs.
Diseases of other organ systems can fall into this group as well, such as cystic fibrosis or type 2 diabetes.
Recognizing the relationship between these diseases has suggested new therapeutic possibilities.
Interfering with the accumulation of the proteins, and possibly as early as their original production within the cell, may unlock new ways to alleviate these devastating diseases.502 CHAPTER 12 | THE

The anatomical divisions are thecentralandperipheralnervoussystems.TheCNSisthebrainandspinalcord.ThePNSiseverythingelse.Functionally, the nervous system can be divided into those regions that are responsible for sensation, those that are responsible for integration,andthosethatareresponsibleforgeneratingresponses.Allofthesefunctionalareasarefoundinboththecentral and peripheral anatomy.
Considering the anatomical regions of the nervous system, there are specific names for the structures within each division.AlocalizedcollectionofneuroncellbodiesisreferredtoasanucleusintheCNSandasaganglioninthePNS.A bundle of axons is referred to as a tract in the CNS and as a nerve in the PNS.
Whereas nuclei and ganglia are specifically in the central or peripheral divisions, axons can cross the boundary between the two.
A single axon can be part of a nerve and a tract.
The name for that specific structure depends on its location.
Nervoustissuecanalsobedescribedasgraymatterandwhitematteronthebasisofitsappearanceinunstainedtissue.
These descriptions are more often used in the CNS.
Gray matter is where nuclei are found and white matter is where tracts are found.
In the PNS, ganglia are basically gray matter and nerves are white matter .
The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of how it controls the body.
The somatic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for functions that result in moving skeletal muscles.
Any sensory or integrative functions that result in the movement of skeletal muscle would be considered somatic.
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for functions that affect cardiac or smooth muscle tissue, or that cause glands to produce their secretions.
Autonomic functions are distributed between central and peripheral regions of the nervous system.
The sensations that lead to autonomic functions can be the same sensations that are part of initiating somatic responses.
Somatic and autonomic integrative functions may overlap as well.
A special division of the nervous system is the enteric nervous system, which is responsible for controlling the digestive organs.
Parts of the autonomic nervous system overlap with the enteric nervous system.
The enteric nervous system is exclusively found in the periphery because it is the nervous tissue in the or gans of the digestive system.
12.2 Nervous Tissue Nervous tissue contains two major cell types, neurons and glial cells.
Neurons are the cells responsible for communication through electrical signals.
Glial cells are supporting cells, maintaining the environment around the neurons.
Neurons are polarized cells, based on the flow of electrical signals along their membrane.
Signals are received at the dendrites, are passed along the cell body, and propagate along the axon towards the target, which may be another neuron, muscle tissue, or a gland.
Many axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin.
Specific types of glial cells provide this insulation.
Several types of glial cells are found in the nervous system, and they can be categorized by the anatomical division in which they are found.
In the CNS, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells are found.
Astrocytes are important for maintaining the chemical environment around the neuron and are crucial for regulating the blood-brain barrier.
Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia in the CNS.
Microglia act as phagocytes and play a role in immune surveillance.
Ependymal cells are responsible for filtering the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid, which is a circulatory fluid that performs some of the functions of blood in the brain and spinal cord because of the BBB.
In the PNS, satellite cells are supporting cells for the neurons, and Schwann cells insulate peripheral axons.
12.3 The Function of Nervous Tissue Sensation starts with the activation of a sensory ending, such as the thermoreceptor in the skin sensing the temperature of the water.
The sensory endings in the skin initiate an electrical signal that travels along the sensory axon within a nerve into the spinal cord, where it synapses with a neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord.
The temperature information represented in that electrical signal is passed to the next neuron by a chemical signal that diffuses across the small gap of the synapse and initiates a new electrical signal in the target cell.
That signal travels through the sensory pathway to the brain, passing through the thalamus, where conscious perception of the water temperature is made possible by the cerebral cortex.
Following integration of that information with other cognitive processes and sensory information, the brain sends a command back down to the spinal cord to initiate a motor response by controlling a skeletal muscle.
The motor pathway is composedoftwocells,theuppermotorneuronandthelowermotorneuron.Theuppermotorneuronhasitscellbodyinthe cerebral cortex and synapses on a cell in the gray matter of the spinal cord.
The lower motor neuron is that cell in the gray matterofthespinalcordanditsaxonextendsintotheperipherywhereitsynapseswithaskeletalmuscleinaneuromuscular junction.
12.4 The Action Potential The nervous system is characterized by electrical signals that are sent from one area to another.
Whether those areas are closeorveryfarapart,thesignalmusttravelalonganaxon.ThebasisoftheelectricalsignalisthecontrolleddistributionofCHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 507 ionsacrossthemembrane.Transmembraneionchannelsregulatewhenionscanmoveinoroutofthecell,sothataprecise signalisgenerated.Thissignalistheactionpotentialwhichhasaverycharacteristicshapebasedonvoltagechangesacross the membrane in a given time period.
The membrane is normally at rest with established Na+and K+concentrations on either side.
A stimulus will start the depolarization of the membrane, and voltage-gated channels will result in further depolarization followed by repolarization of the membrane.
A slight overshoot of hyperpolarization marks the end of the action potential.
While an action potential is in progress, another cannot be generated under the same conditions.
While the voltage-gated Na+channel is inactivated, absolutely no action potentials can be generated.
Once that channel has returned to its resting state, a new action potential is possible, but it must be started by a relatively stronger stimulus to overcome the K+leaving the cell.
The action potential travels down the axon as voltage-gated ion channels are opened by the spreading depolarization.
In unmyelinated axons, this happens in a continuous fashion because there are voltage-gated channels throughout the membrane.In myelinatedaxons, propagation is described as saltatory because voltage-gatedchannels are only found at the nodes of Ranvier and the electrical events seem to ‚Äújump‚Äù from one node to the next.
Saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction, meaning that myelinated axons propagate their signals faster.
The diameter of the axon also makes a difference as ions diffusing within the cell have less resistance in a wider space.
12.5 Communication Between Neurons The basis of the electrical signal within a neuron is the action potential that propagates down the axon.
For a neuron to generateanactionpotential,itneedstoreceiveinputfromanothersource,eitheranotherneuronorasensorystimulus.That input will result in opening ion channels in the neuron, resulting in a graded potential based on the strength of the stimulus.
Graded potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing and can summate to affect the probability of the neuron reaching threshold.
Graded potentials can be the result of sensory stimuli.
If the sensory stimulus is received by the dendrites of a unipolar sensory neuron, such as the sensory neuron ending in the skin, the graded potential is called a generator potential because it can directly generate the action potential in the initial segment of the axon.
If the sensory stimulus is received by a specialized sensory receptor cell, the graded potential is called a receptor potential.
Graded potentials produced by interactions between neurons at synapses are called postsynaptic potentials (PSPs).
A depolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called an excitatory PSP, and a hyperpolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called an inhibitory PSP.
Synapses are the contacts between neurons, which can either be chemical or electrical in nature.
Chemical synapses arefarmorecommon.Atachemicalsynapse,neurotransmitterisreleasedfromthepresynapticelementanddiffusesacross the synaptic cleft.
The neurotransmitter binds to a receptor protein and causes a change in the postsynaptic membrane (the PSP).
The neurotransmitter must be inactivated or removed from the synaptic cleft so that the stimulus is limited in time.
The particular characteristics of a synapse vary based on the neurotransmitter system produced by that neuron.
The cholinergic system is found at the neuromuscular junction and in certain places within the nervous system.
Amino acids, such as glutamate, glycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are used as neurotransmitters.
Other neurotransmitters are the result of amino acids being enzymatically changed, as in the biogenic amines, or being covalently bonded together, as in the neuropeptides.
INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS 1.In 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for discoveries related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
This is a tool to see the structures of the body (not just the nervous system) that depends on magnetic fields associated with certain atomic nuclei.
The utility of this technique in the nervous system is that fat tissue and water appear as different shades between black and white.

7.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ summation) to learn about summation.

Does spatial summation have to happen all at once, or can the separate signals arrive on the postsynaptic neuron at slightly different times?
Explain your answer.
8.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ neurotrans) to learn about the release of a neurotransmitter.
The action potential reaches the end of the axon, called the axon terminal, and a chemical signal is released to tell the target cell to do something, either initiate a new action potential, or to suppress that activity.
In a very short space, the electrical signal of the action potential is changed into the chemical signal of a neurotransmitter, and then back to electrical changes in the target cell membrane.
What is the importance of voltage-gated calcium channels in the release of neurotransmitters?

(credit: Rhett Sutphin) Introduction Chapter Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Relate the developmental processes of the embryonic nervous system to the adult structures ‚Ä¢Name the major regions of the adult nervous system ‚Ä¢Locate regions of the cerebral cortex on the basis of anatomical landmarks common to all human brains ‚Ä¢Describe the regions of the spinal cord in cross-section ‚Ä¢List the cranial nerves in order of anatomical location and provide the central and peripheral connections ‚Ä¢List the spinal nerves by vertebral region and by which nerve plexus each supplies The nervous system is responsible for controlling much of the body, both through somatic (voluntary) and autonomic (involuntary) functions.
The structures of the nervous system must be described in detail to understand how many of these functions are possible.
There is a physiological concept known as localization of function that states that certain structures are specifically responsible for prescribed functions.
It is an underlying concept in all of anatomy and physiology, but the nervous system illustrates the concept very well.
Fresh,unstainednervoustissuecanbedescribedasgrayorwhitematter,andwithinthosetwotypesoftissueitcanbe very hard to see any detail.
However, as specific regions and structures have been described, they were related to specificCHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 513 functions.
Understanding these structures and the functions they perform requires a detailed description of the anatomy of the nervous system, delving deep into what the central and peripheral structures are.
Theplacetostartthisstudyofthenervoussystemisthebeginningoftheindividualhumanlife,withinthewomb.The embryonic development of the nervous system allows for a simple framework on which progressively more complicated structures can be built.
With this framework in place, a thorough investigation of the nervous system is possible.
13.1|The Embryologic Perspective By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the growth and differentiation of the neural tube ‚Ä¢Relate the different stages of development to the adult structures of the central nervous system ‚Ä¢Explain the expansion of the ventricular system of the adult brain from the central canal of the neural tube ‚Ä¢Describe the connections of the diencephalon and cerebellum on the basis of patterns of embryonic development The brain is a complex organ composed of gray parts and white matter, which can be hard to distinguish.
Starting from an embryologic perspective allows you to understand more easily how the parts relate to each other.
The embryonic nervous system begins as a very simple structure‚Äîessentially just a straight line, which then gets increasingly complex.
Looking at the development of the nervous system with a couple of early snapshots makes it easier to understand the whole complex system.
Many structures that appear to be adjacent in the adult brain are not connected, and the connections that exist may seem arbitrary.
But there is an underlying order to the system that comes from how different parts develop.
By following the developmental pattern, it is possible to learn what the major regions of the nervous system are.
The Neural Tube To begin, a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become a fertilized egg.
The fertilized egg cell, or zygote, starts dividing to generate the cells that make up an entire organism.
Sixteen days after fertilization, the developing embryo‚Äôs cells belong to one of three germ layers that give rise to the different tissues in the body.
The endoderm, or inner tissue, is responsible for generatingtheliningtissuesofvariousspaceswithinthebody,suchasthemucosaeofthedigestiveandrespiratorysystems.
The mesoderm, or middle tissue, gives rise to most of the muscle and connective tissues.
Finally the ectoderm, or outer tissue, develops into the integumentary system (the skin) and the nervous system.
It is probably not difficult to see that the outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body .
But how is it responsible for the nervous system?
As the embryo develops, a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm, which is the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system.
Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the neuroepithelium,forminga neuralplate.Thecellsthenbegintochangeshape,causingthetissuetobuckleandfoldinward (Figure13.2 ).Aneuralgroove forms,visibleasalinealongthedorsalsurfaceoftheembryo.Theridge-likeedgeoneither side of the neural groove is referred as the neural fold.
As the neural folds come together and converge, the underlying structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called the neural tube.
Cells from the neural folds then separate from theectodermtoformaclusterofcellsreferredtoasthe neuralcrest,whichrunslateraltotheneuraltube.Theneuralcrest migrates away from the nascent, or embryonic, central nervous system (CNS) that will form along the neural groove and develops into several parts of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including the enteric nervous tissue.

As the two sides of the neural groove converge, they form the neural tube, which lies beneath the ectoderm.
The anterior end of the neural tube will develop into the brain, and the posterior portion will become the spinal cord.
The neural crest develops into peripheral structures.
At this point, the early nervous system is a simple, hollow tube.
It runs from the anterior end of the embryo to the posterior end.
Beginning at 25 days, the anterior end develops into the brain, and the posterior portion becomes the spinal cord.Thisisthemostbasicarrangementoftissueinthenervoussystem,anditgivesrisetothemorecomplexstructuresby the fourth week of development.
Primary Vesicles Astheanteriorendoftheneuraltubestartstodevelopintothebrain,itundergoesacoupleofenlargements;theresultisthe production of sac-like vesicles.
Similar to a child‚Äôs balloon animal, the long, straight neural tube begins to take on a new shape.
Three vesicles form at the first stage, which are called primary vesicles.
These vesicles are given names that are based on Greek words, the main root word being enkephalon , which means ‚Äúbrain‚Äù (en- = ‚Äúinside‚Äù; kephalon = ‚Äúhead‚Äù).
The prefix to each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the developing nervous system.
Theprosencephalon (pros- = ‚Äúin front‚Äù) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to mean forebrain.
The mesencephalon (mes- = ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù) is the next vesicle, which can be called the midbrain.
The third vesicle atthisstageisthe rhombencephalon.Thefirstpartofthiswordisalsotherootofthewordrhombus,whichisageometrical figurewithfoursidesofequallength(asquareisarhombuswith90¬∞angles).Whereasprosencephalonandmesencephalon translate into the English words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for ‚Äúfour-sided-figure-brain.‚Äù However, the third vesicle can be called the hindbrain.
One way of thinking about how the brain is arranged is to use these three regions‚Äîforebrain,midbrain,andhindbrain‚Äîwhicharebasedontheprimaryvesiclestageofdevelopment(Figure13.3a).
Secondary Vesicles The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b).
The three primary vesicles become five secondary vesicles.
The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the diencephalon.Thetelecephalonwillbecomethecerebrum.Thediencephalongivesrisetoseveraladultstructures;twothat will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus.
In the embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina.
This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully formed nervous system.
The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions.
The midbrain is an established region of the brain attheprimaryvesiclestageofdevelopmentandremainsthatway.Therestofthebraindevelopsarounditandconstitutesa largepercentageofthemassofthebrain.Dividingthebrainintoforebrain,midbrain,andhindbrainisusefulinconsidering its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking.
Therhombencephalondevelopsintothe metencephalon andmyelencephalon.Themetencephaloncorrespondstothe adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum.
The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning ‚Äúlittle brain‚Äù) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself.
The most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of the same vesicle.
The myelencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the medulla oblongata.
The structures that come from the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, except for the cerebellum, are collectively considered the brain stem, which specifically includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 515 Figure 13.3 Primary and Secondary Vesicle Stages of Development The embryonic brain develops complexity through enlargements of the neural tube called vesicles; (a) The primary vesicle stage has three regions, and (b) the secondary vesicle stage has five regions.
Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/braindevel) to examine the development of the brain, starting with the neural tube.
As the anterior end of the neural tube develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles that establishtheforebrain,midbrain,andhindbrain.Thosestructurescontinuetodevelopthroughouttherestofembryonic development and into adolescence.
They are the basis of the structure of the fully developed adult brain.
How would you describe the difference in the relative sizes of the three regions of the brain when comparing the early (25th embryonic day) brain and the adult brain?
Spinal Cord Development While the brain is developing from the anterior neural tube, the spinal cord is developing from the posterior neural tube.
However, its structure does not differ from the basic layout of the neural tube.
It is a long, straight cord with a small, hollow space down the center.
The neural tube is defined in terms of its anterior versus posterior portions, but it also has a dorsal‚Äìventraldimension.Astheneuraltubeseparatesfromtherestoftheectoderm,thesideclosesttothesurfaceisdorsal, and the deeper side is ventral.
Asthespinalcorddevelops,thecellsmakingupthewalloftheneuraltubeproliferateanddifferentiateintotheneurons and glia of the spinal cord.
The dorsal tissues will be associated with sensory functions, and the ventral tissues will be associated with motor functions.
Relating Embryonic Development to the Adult Brain Embryonic development can help in understanding the structure of the adult brain because it establishes a framework on which more complex structures can be built.
First, the neural tube establishes the anterior‚Äìposterior dimension of the nervous system, which is called the neuraxis.
The embryonic nervous system in mammals can be said to have a standard arrangement.Humans(andotherprimates,tosomedegree)makethiscomplicatedbystandingupandwalkingontwolegs.
The anterior‚Äìposterior dimension of the neuraxis overlays the superior‚Äìinferior dimension of the body.
However, there is a major curve between the brain stem and forebrain, which is called the cephalic flexure.
Because of this, the neuraxis starts in an inferior position‚Äîthe end of the spinal cord‚Äîand ends in an anterior position, the front of the cerebrum.
If this is confusing, just imagine a four-legged animal standing up on two legs.
Without the flexure in the brain stem, and at the top of the neck, that animal would be looking straight up instead of straight in front ( Figure 13.4 ).516 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 13.4 Human Neuraxis The mammalian nervous system is arranged with the neural tube running along an anterior to posterior axis, from nose to tail for a four-legged animal like a dog.
Humans, as two-legged animals, have a bend in the neuraxis between the brain stem and the diencephalon, along with a bend in the neck, so that the eyes and the face are oriented forward.
In summary, the primary vesicles help to establish the basic regions of the nervous system: forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.
These divisions are useful in certain situations, but they are not equivalent regions.
The midbrain is small compared with the hindbrain and particularly the forebrain.
The secondary vesicles go on to establish the major regions of the adult nervous system that will be followed in this text.
The telencephalon is the cerebrum, which is the major portion of the human brain.
The diencephalon continues to be referred to by this Greek name, because there is no better term for it (dia- = ‚Äúthrough‚Äù).
The diencephalon is between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system and can be describedastheregionthroughwhichallprojectionshavetopassbetweenthecerebrumandeverythingelse.Thebrainstem includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla, which correspond to the mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon.
The cerebellum, being a large portion of the brain, is considered a separate region.
Table 13.1 connects the different stages of development to the adult structures of the CNS.
One other benefit of considering embryonic development is that certain connections are more obvious because of how these adult structures are related.
The retina, which began as part of the diencephalon, is primarily connected to the diencephalon.
The eyes are just inferior to the anterior-most part of the cerebrum, but the optic nerve extends back to the thalamus as the optic tract, with branches into a region of the hypothalamus.
There is also a connection of the optic tract to the midbrain, but the mesencephalon is adjacent to the diencephalon, so that is not difficult to imagine.
The cerebellum originates out of the metencephalon, and its largest white matter connection is to the pons, also from the metencephalon.
There are connections between the cerebellum and both the medulla and midbrain, which are adjacent structures in the secondaryvesiclestageofdevelopment.Intheadultbrain,thecerebellumseemsclosetothecerebrum,butthereisnodirect connection between them.
Another aspect of the adult CNS structures that relates to embryonic development is the ventricles‚Äîopen spaces withintheCNSwherecerebrospinalfluidcirculates.Theyaretheremnantofthehollowcenteroftheneuraltube.Thefour ventricles and the tubular spaces associated with them can be linked back to the hollow center of the embryonic brain (see Table 13.1).

A groove forms along the dorsal surfaceoftheembryo,whichbecomesdeeperuntilitsedgesmeetandcloseofftoformthetube.Ifthisfailstohappen, especially in the posterior region where the spinal cord forms, a developmental defect called spina bifida occurs.
The closingof theneuraltubeis importantfor morethanjust theproper formationof thenervous system.
Thesurrounding tissues are dependent on the correct development of the tube.
The connective tissues surrounding the CNS can be involved as well.
There are three classes of this disorder: occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (Figure 13.5).
The first type, spina bifida occulta, is the mildest because the vertebral bones do not fully surround the spinal cord, but the spinal cord itself is not affected.
No functional differences may be noticed, which is what the word occulta means; it is hidden spina bifida.
The other two types both involve the formation of a cyst‚Äîa fluid-filled sac of the connective tissues that cover the spinal cord called the meninges.
‚ÄúMeningocele‚Äù means that the meninges protrude through the spinal column but nerves may not be involved and few symptoms are present, though complications may arise later in life.
‚ÄúMyelomeningocele‚Äù means that the meninges protrude and spinal nerves are involved, and therefore severe neurological symptoms can be present.
Often surgery to close the opening or to remove the cyst is necessary.
The earlier that surgery can be performed, the better the chances of controlling or limiting further damage or infection at the opening.
For many children with meningocele, surgery will alleviate the pain, although they may experience some functional loss.
Because the myelomeningocele form of spina bifida involves more extensive damage to the nervous tissue, neurological damage maypersist,butsymptomscanoftenbehandled.Complicationsofthespinalcordmaypresentlaterinlife,butoverall life expectancy is not reduced.
Figure 13.5 Spinal Bifida (a) Spina bifida is a birth defect of the spinal cord caused when the neural tube does not completely close, but the rest of development continues.
The result is the emergence of meninges and neural tissue through the vertebral column.
(b) Fetal myelomeningocele is evident in this ultrasound taken at 21 weeks.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 519 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/whitematter) to learn about the white matter in the cerebrum that develops during childhood and adolescence.

13.2|The Central Nervous System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Name the major regions of the adult brain ‚Ä¢Describe the connections between the cerebrum and brain stem through the diencephalon, and from those regions into the spinal cord ‚Ä¢Recognize the complex connections within the subcortical structures of the basal nuclei ‚Ä¢Explain the arrangement of gray and white matter in the spinal cord The brain and the spinal cord are the central nervous system, and they represent the main organs of the nervous system.
The spinal cord is a single structure, whereas the adult brain is described in terms of four major regions: the cerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum.
A person‚Äôs conscious experiences are based on neural activity in the brain.
The regulation of homeostasis is governed by a specialized region in the brain.
The coordination of reflexes depends on the integration of sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord.
The Cerebrum The iconic gray mantle of the human brain, which appears to make up most of the mass of the brain, is the cerebrum (Figure 13.6).
The wrinkled portion is the cerebral cortex, and the rest of the structure is beneath that outer covering.
Thereisalargeseparationbetweenthetwosidesofthecerebrumcalledthe longitudinalfissure.Itseparatesthecerebrum into two distinct halves, a right and left cerebral hemisphere.
Deep within the cerebrum, the white matter of the corpus callosum provides the major pathway for communication between the two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex.520 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 13.6 The Cerebrum The cerebrum is a large component of the CNS in humans, and the most obvious aspect of it is the folded surface called the cerebral cortex.
Many of the higher neurological functions, such as memory, emotion, and consciousness, are the result of cerebral function.
The complexity of the cerebrum is different across vertebrate species.
The cerebrum of the most primitive vertebrates is not much more than the connection for the sense of smell.
In mammals, the cerebrum comprises the outer gray matter that is the cortex (from the Latin word meaning ‚Äúbark of a tree‚Äù) and several deep nuclei that belong to three important functional groups.
The basal nuclei are responsible for cognitive processing, the most important function being that associated with planning movements.
The basal forebrain contains nuclei that are important in learning and memory.
Thelimbic cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex that is part of the limbic system, a collection of structures involved in emotion, memory, and behavior.
Cerebral Cortex The cerebrum is covered by a continuous layer of gray matter that wraps around either side of the forebrain‚Äîthe cerebral cortex.
This thin, extensive region of wrinkled gray matter is responsible for the higher functions of the nervous system.
A gyrus(plural=gyri)istheridgeofoneofthosewrinkles,anda sulcus(plural=sulci)isthegroovebetweentwogyri.The pattern of these folds of tissue indicates specific regions of the cerebral cortex.
Theheadislimitedbythesizeofthebirthcanal,andthebrainmustfitinsidethecranialcavityoftheskull.Extensive folding in the cerebral cortex enables more gray matter to fit into this limited space.
If the gray matter of the cortex were peeled off of the cerebrum and laid out flat, its surface area would be roughly equal to one square meter.
The folding of the cortex maximizes the amount of gray matter in the cranial cavity.
During embryonic development, as the telencephalon expands within the skull, the brain goes through a regular course of growth that results in everyone‚Äôs brainhavingasimilarpatternoffolds.Thesurfaceofthebraincanbemappedonthebasisofthelocationsoflargegyriand sulci.Usingtheselandmarks,thecortexcanbeseparatedintofourmajorregions,orlobes(Figure13.7).The lateralsulcus thatseparatesthe temporallobe fromtheotherregionsisonesuchlandmark.Superiortothelateralsulcusarethe parietal lobeandfrontal lobe, which are separated from each other by the central sulcus.
The posterior region of the cortex is the occipital lobe, which has no obvious anatomical border between it and the parietal or temporal lobes on the lateral surface of the brain.
From the medial surface, an obvious landmark separating the parietal and occipital lobes is called the parieto- occipitalsulcus .Thefactthatthereisnoobviousanatomicalborderbetweentheselobesisconsistentwiththefunctionsof these regions being interrelated.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 521 Figure 13.7 Lobes of the Cerebral Cortex The cerebral cortex is divided into four lobes.
Extensive folding increases the surface area available for cerebral functions.
Different regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with particular functions, a concept known as localization of function.
In the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study of the microscopic anatomy‚Äîthe cytoarchitecture‚Äîof the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52 separate regions on the basis of the histology of the cortex.
His work resulted in a system of classification known as Brodmann‚Äôs areas, which is still used today to describe the anatomical distinctions within the cortex ( Figure 13.8 ).
The results from Brodmann‚Äôs work on the anatomy align very well with the functional differences within the cortex.
Areas 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe are responsibleforprimaryvisualperception.Thatvisualinformationiscomplex,soitisprocessedinthetemporalandparietal lobes as well.
Thetemporallobeisassociatedwithprimaryauditorysensation,knownasBrodmann‚Äôsareas41and42inthesuperior temporal lobe.
Because regions of the temporal lobe are part of the limbic system, memory is an important function associated with that lobe.
Memory is essentially a sensory function; memories are recalled sensations such as the smell of Mom‚Äôsbakingorthesoundofabarkingdog.Evenmemoriesofmovementarereallythememoryofsensoryfeedbackfrom those movements, such as stretching muscles or the movement of the skin around a joint.
Structures in the temporal lobe are responsible for establishing long-term memory, but the ultimate location of those memories is usually in the region in which the sensory perception was processed.
The main sensation associated with the parietal lobe is somatosensation , meaning the general sensations associated withthebody.Posteriortothecentralsulcusisthe postcentralgyrus,theprimarysomatosensorycortex,whichisidentified as Brodmann‚Äôs areas 1, 2, and 3.

Anterior to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe, which is primarily associated with motor functions.
The precentral gyrusis the primary motor cortex.
Cells from this region of the cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that instruct cells in the spinal cord to move skeletal muscles.
Anterior to this region are a few areas that are associated with planned movements.The premotorarea isresponsibleforthinkingofamovementtobemade.The frontaleyefields areimportant in eliciting eye movements and in attending to visual stimuli.
Broca‚Äôs area is responsible for the production of language, or controlling movements responsible for speech; in the vast majority of people, it is located only on the left side.
Anterior to these regions is the prefrontal lobe , which serves cognitive functions that can be the basis of personality, short-term memory,andconsciousness.Theprefrontallobotomyisanoutdatedmodeoftreatmentforpersonalitydisorders(psychiatric conditions) that profoundly affected the personality of the patient.522 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 13.8 Brodmann's Areas of the Cerebral Cortex Brodmann mapping of functionally distinct regions of the cortex was based on its cytoarchitecture at a microscopic level.

The hippocampus andamygdala are medial-lobe structures that, along with the adjacent cortex, are involved in long-term memory formation and emotional responses.
The basal nuclei are a set of nuclei in the cerebrum responsible for comparing cortical processing with the general state of activity in the nervous system to influence the likelihood of movement taking place.
For example, while a student is sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture, the basal nuclei will keep the urge to jump up and scream from actually happening.
(The basal nuclei are also referred to as the basal ganglia, although that is potentially confusing because the term ganglia is typically used for peripheral structures.)
Themajorstructuresofthebasalnucleithatcontrolmovementarethe caudate, putamen,and globuspallidus,which are located deep in the cerebrum.
The caudate is a long nucleus that follows the basic C-shape of the cerebrum from the frontal lobe, through the parietal and occipital lobes, into the temporal lobe.
The putamen is mostly deep in the anterior regions of the frontal and parietal lobes.
Together, the caudate and putamen are called the striatum.
The globus pallidus is a layered nucleus that lies just medial to the putamen; they are called the lenticular nuclei because they look like curved pieces fitting together like lenses.
The globus pallidus has two subdivisions, the external and internal segments, which are lateral and medial, respectively.
These nuclei are depicted in a frontal section of the brain in Figure 13.9 .CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 523 Figure 13.9 Frontal Section of Cerebral Cortex and Basal Nuclei The major components of the basal nuclei, shown in a frontal section of the brain, are the caudate (just lateral to the lateral ventricle), the putamen (inferior to the caudate and separated by the large white-matter structure called the internal capsule), and the globus pallidus (medial to the putamen).
Thebasalnucleiinthecerebrumareconnectedwithafewmorenucleiinthebrainstemthattogetheractasafunctional group that forms a motor pathway.
Two streams of information processing take place in the basal nuclei.
All input to the basal nuclei is from the cortex into the striatum (Figure 13.10 ).
Thedirect pathway is the projection of axons from the striatum to the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr).
The GPi/SNr then projects to the thalamus, which projects back to the cortex.
The indirect pathway is the projection of axons from the striatum to the globus pallidus external segment (GPe), then to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and finally to GPi/SNr.
The two streams both target the GPi/SNr, but one has a direct projection and the other goes through a few intervening nuclei.
The direct pathway causes the disinhibition of the thalamus (inhibition of one cell on a target cell that then inhibits the first cell), whereas the indirect pathway causes, or reinforces, the normal inhibition of the thalamus.
The thalamus then can either excite the cortex (as a result of the direct pathway) or fail to excite the cortex (as a result of the indirect pathway).524 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure13.10ConnectionsofBasalNuclei Input to the basal nuclei is from the cerebral cortex, which is an excitatory connection releasing glutamate as a neurotransmitter.
This input is to the striatum, or the caudate and putamen.
In the direct pathway, the striatum projects to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (GPi/SNr).
This is an inhibitory pathway, in which GABA is released at the synapse, and the target cells are hyperpolarized and less likely to fire.
The output from the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which is an inhibitory projection using GABA.
The switch between the two pathways is the substantia nigra pars compacta, which projects to the striatum and releasestheneurotransmitterdopamine.Dopaminereceptorsareeitherexcitatory(D1-typereceptors)orinhibitory(D2-type receptors).
The direct pathway is activated by dopamine, and the indirect pathway is inhibited by dopamine.
When the substantia nigra pars compacta is firing, it signals to the basal nuclei that the body is in an active state, and movement will be more likely.
When the substantia nigra pars compacta is silent, the body is in a passive state, and movement is inhibited.
Toillustratethissituation,whileastudentissittinglisteningtoalecture,thesubstantianigraparscompactawouldbesilent and the student less likely to get up and walk around.
Likewise, while the professor is lecturing, and walking around at the front of the classroom, the professor‚Äôs substantia nigra pars compacta would be active, in keeping with his or her activity level.

The Myth of Left Brain/Right Brain There is a persistent myth that people are ‚Äúright-brained‚Äù or ‚Äúleft-brained,‚Äù which is an oversimplification of an important concept about the cerebral hemispheres.
There is some lateralization of function, in which the left side of the brain is devoted to language function and the right side is devoted to spatial and nonverbal reasoning.
Whereas thesefunctionsarepredominantlyassociatedwiththosesidesofthebrain,thereisnomonopolybyeithersideonthese functions.
Many pervasive functions, such as language, are distributed globally around the cerebrum.
Some of the support for this misconception has come from studies of split brains.
A drastic way to deal with a rareanddevastatingneurologicalcondition(intractableepilepsy)istoseparatethetwohemispheresofthebrain.After sectioning the corpus callosum, a split-brained patient will have trouble producing verbal responses on the basis of sensory information processed on the right side of the cerebrum, leading to the idea that the left side is responsible for language function.
However, there are well-documented cases of language functions lost from damage to the right side of the brain.
The deficits seen in damage to the left side of the brain are classified as aphasia, a loss of speech function; damage on the right side can affect the use of language.
Right-side damage can result in a loss of ability to understand figurative aspects of speech, such as jokes, irony, or metaphors.
Nonverbal aspects of speech can be affected by damage to the right side, such as facial expression or body language, and right-side damage can lead to a ‚Äúflat affect‚Äù in speech, or a loss of emotional expression in speech‚Äîsounding like a robot when talking.
The Diencephalon The diencephalon is the one region of the adult brain that retains its name from embryologic development.

In the earliest vertebrate species, the cerebrum was not much more than olfactory bulbs that receivedperipheralinformationabout the chemicalenvironment(to call it smell in these organisms is imprecise because they lived in the ocean).
The diencephalon is deep beneath the cerebrum and constitutes the walls of the third ventricle.
The diencephalon can be described as any region of the brain with ‚Äúthalamus‚Äù in its name.
The two major regions of the diencephalon are the thalamus itself and the hypothalamus (Figure 13.11 ).
There are other structures, such as the epithalamus, which contains the pineal gland, or the subthalamus , which includes the subthalamic nucleus that is part of the basal nuclei.
Thalamus Thethalamus is a collection of nuclei that relay information between the cerebral cortex and the periphery, spinal cord, or brain stem.
All sensory information, except for the sense of smell, passes through the thalamus before processing by the cortex.
Axons from the peripheral sensory organs, or intermediate nuclei, synapse in the thalamus, and thalamic neurons project directly to the cerebrum.
It is a requisite synapse in any sensory pathway, except for olfaction.
The thalamus does526 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 not just pass the information on, it also processes that information.
For example, the portion of the thalamus that receives visual information will influence what visual stimuli are important, or what receives attention.
The cerebrum also sends information down to the thalamus, which usually communicates motor commands.
This involves interactions with the cerebellum and other nuclei in the brain stem.
The cerebrum interacts with the basal nuclei, which involves connections with the thalamus.
The primary output of the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which relays that output to the cerebral cortex.
The cortex also sends information to the thalamus that will then influence the effects of the basal nuclei.
Hypothalamus Inferior and slightly anterior to the thalamus is the hypothalamus , the other major region of the diencephalon.
The hypothalamus is a collection of nuclei that are largely involved in regulating homeostasis.
The hypothalamus is the executive region in charge of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system through its regulation of the anterior pituitary gland.
Other parts of the hypothalamus are involved in memory and emotion as part of the limbic system.
Figure 13.11 The Diencephalon The diencephalon is composed primarily of the thalamus and hypothalamus, which together define the walls of the third ventricle.
The thalami are two elongated, ovoid structures on either side of the midline that make contact in the middle.
The hypothalamus is inferior and anterior to the thalamus, culminating in a sharp angle to which the pituitary gland is attached.
Brain Stem The midbrain and hindbrain (composed of the pons and the medulla) are collectively referred to as the brain stem (Figure 13.12).
The structure emerges from the ventral surface of the forebrain as a tapering cone that connects the brain to the spinal cord.
Attached to the brain stem, but considered a separate region of the adult brain, is the cerebellum.
The midbrain coordinates sensory representations of the visual, auditory, and somatosensory perceptual spaces.
The pons is the main connection with the cerebellum.
The pons and the medulla regulate several crucial functions, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and rates.
The cranial nerves connect through the brain stem and provide the brain with the sensory input and motor output associated with the head and neck, including most of the special senses.
The major ascending and descending pathways between the spinal cord and brain, specifically the cerebrum, pass through the brain stem.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 527 Figure 13.12 The Brain Stem The brain stem comprises three regions: the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla.
Midbrain One of the original regions of the embryonic brain, the midbrain is a small region between the thalamus and pons.
It is separated into the tectumandtegmentum, from the Latin words for roof and floor, respectively.
The cerebral aqueduct passes through the center of the midbrain, such that these regions are the roof and floor of that canal.
Thetectumiscomposedoffourbumpsknownasthecolliculi(singular=colliculus),whichmeans‚Äúlittlehill‚ÄùinLatin.
Theinferior colliculus is the inferior pair of these enlargements and is part of the auditory brain stem pathway.
Neurons of the inferior colliculus project to the thalamus, which then sends auditory information to the cerebrum for the conscious perception of sound.
The superior colliculus is the superior pair and combines sensory information about visual space, auditory space, and somatosensory space.
Activity in the superior colliculus is related to orienting the eyes to a sound or touch stimulus.
If you are walking along the sidewalk on campus and you hear chirping,the superior colliculuscoordinates that information with your awareness of the visual location of the tree right above you.
That is the correlation of auditory and visual maps.
If you suddenly feel something wet fall on your head, your superior colliculus integrates that with the auditory and visual maps and you know that the chirping bird just relieved itself on you.
You want to look up to see the culprit, but do not.
The tegmentum is continuous with the gray matter of the rest of the brain stem.
Throughout the midbrain, pons, and medulla,thetegmentumcontainsthenucleithatreceiveandsendinformationthroughthecranialnerves,aswellasregions that regulate important functions such as those of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
Pons The word pons comes from the Latin word for bridge.
It is visible on the anterior surface of the brain stem as the thick bundle of white matter attached to the cerebellum.
The pons is the main connection between the cerebellum and the brain stem.
The bridge-like white matter is only the anterior surface of the pons; the gray matter beneath that is a continuation of the tegmentumfrom the midbrain.Gray matterin the tegmentumregion of the pons containsneurons receivingdescending input from the forebrain that is sent to the cerebellum.
Medulla The medulla is the region known as the myelencephalon in the embryonic brain.
The initial portion of the name, ‚Äúmyel,‚Äù refers to the significant white matter found in this region‚Äîespecially on its exterior, which is continuous with the white matter of the spinal cord.
The tegmentum of the midbrain and pons continues into the medulla because this gray matter is responsible for processing cranial nerve information.
A diffuse region of gray matter throughout the brain stem, known as thereticular formation , is related to sleep and wakefulness, such as general brain activity and attention.
The Cerebellum Thecerebellum,asthenamesuggests,isthe‚Äúlittlebrain.‚ÄùItiscoveredingyriandsulcilikethecerebrum,andlookslikea miniature version of that part of the brain (Figure 13.13 ).
The cerebellum is largely responsible for comparing information528 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 from the cerebrum with sensory feedback from the periphery through the spinal cord.
It accounts for approximately 10 percent of the mass of the brain.
Figure 13.13 The Cerebellum The cerebellum is situated on the posterior surface of the brain stem.
Descending input from the cerebellum enters through the large white matter structure of the pons.
Ascending input from the periphery and spinal cord enters through the fibers of the inferior olive.
Output goes to the midbrain, which sends a descending signal to the spinal cord.
Descendingfibersfromthecerebrumhavebranchesthatconnecttoneuronsinthepons.Thoseneuronsprojectintothe cerebellum, providing a copy of motor commands sent to the spinal cord.
Sensory information from the periphery, which enters through spinal or cranial nerves, is copied to a nucleus in the medulla known as the inferior olive.
Fibers from this nucleus enter the cerebellum and are compared with the descending commands from the cerebrum.
If the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe sends a command down to the spinal cord to initiate walking, a copy of that instruction is sent to thecerebellum.Sensoryfeedbackfromthemusclesandjoints,proprioceptiveinformationaboutthemovementsofwalking, andsensationsofbalancearesenttothecerebellumthroughtheinferioroliveandthecerebellumcomparesthem.Ifwalking is not coordinated, perhaps because the ground is uneven or a strong wind is blowing, then the cerebellum sends out a correctivecommandtocompensateforthedifferencebetweentheoriginalcorticalcommandandthesensoryfeedback.The outputofthecerebellumisintothemidbrain,whichthensendsadescendinginputtothespinalcordtocorrectthemessages going to skeletal muscles.
The Spinal Cord The description of the CNS is concentrated on the structures of the brain, but the spinal cord is another major organ of the system.Whereasthebraindevelopsoutofexpansionsoftheneuraltubeintoprimaryandthensecondaryvesicles,thespinal cord maintains the tube structure and is only specialized into certain regions.
As the spinal cord continues to develop in the newborn, anatomical features mark its surface.
The anterior midline is marked by the anterior median fissure, and the posterior midline is marked by the posterior median sulcus.
Axons enter the posterior side through the dorsal (posterior) nerveroot,whichmarksthe posterolateralsulcus oneitherside.Theaxonsemergingfromtheanteriorsidedosothrough theventral (anterior) nerve root.
Note that it is common to see the terms dorsal (dorsal = ‚Äúback‚Äù) and ventral (ventral =CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 529 ‚Äúbelly‚Äù)usedinterchangeablywithposteriorandanterior,particularlyinreferencetonervesandthestructuresofthespinal cord.
You should learn to be comfortable with both.
On the whole, the posterior regions are responsible for sensory functions and the anterior regions are associated with motor functions.
This comes from the initial development of the spinal cord, which is divided into the basal plate and the alar plate.
The basal plate is closest to the ventral midline of the neural tube, which will become the anterior face of the spinal cord and gives rise to motor neurons.
The alar plate is on the dorsal side of the neural tube and gives rise to neurons that will receive sensory input from the periphery.
The length of the spinal cord is divided into regions that correspond to the regions of the vertebral column.

The sacral spinal cord is at the level of the upperlumbarvertebralbones.Thespinalnervesextendfromtheirvariouslevelstotheproperlevelofthevertebralcolumn.
Gray Horns In cross-section, the gray matter of the spinal cord has the appearance of an ink-blot test, with the spread of the gray matter on one side replicated on the other‚Äîa shape reminiscent of a bulbous capital ‚ÄúH.‚Äù As shown in Figure 13.14, the gray matter is subdivided into regions that are referred to as horns.
The posterior horn is responsible for sensory processing.
Theanterior horn sends out motor signals to the skeletal muscles.
The lateral horn, which is only found in the thoracic, upper lumbar, and sacral regions, is the central component of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.
Some of the largest neurons of the spinal cord are the multipolar motor neurons in the anterior horn.
The fibers that cause contraction of skeletal muscles are the axons of these neurons.
The motor neuron that causes contraction of the big toe, for example, is located in the sacral spinal cord.
The axon that has to reach all the way to the belly of that muscle may be a meter in length.
The neuronal cell body that maintains that long fiber must be quite large, possibly several hundred micrometers in diameter, making it one of the largest cells in the body.
Figure13.14Cross-sectionofSpinalCord The cross-section of a thoracic spinal cord segment shows the posterior, anterior, and lateral horns of gray matter, as well as the posterior, anterior, and lateral columns of white matter.

Ascending tractsof nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tracts carry motor commands from the brain.
Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as continuous bands of white matter.
Between the two posterior horns of gray matter are the posterior columns.
Between the two anterior horns, and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from that gray matter area, are the anterior columns.
The white matter on either side of the spinal cord, between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn neurons,arethe lateralcolumns.Theposteriorcolumnsarecomposedofaxonsofascendingtracts.Theanteriorandlateral columns are composed of many different groups of axons of both ascending and descending tracts‚Äîthe latter carrying motor commands down from the brain to the spinal cord to control output to the periphery .
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/graymatter) to learn about the gray matter of the spinal cord that receives input from fibers of the dorsal (posterior) root and sends information out through the fibers of the ventral (anterior) root.

Basal Nuclei Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a disorder of the basal nuclei, specifically of the substantia nigra, that demonstrates the effects of the direct and indirect pathways.
Parkinson‚Äôs disease is the result of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta dying.Theseneuronsreleasedopamineintothestriatum.Withoutthatmodulatoryinfluence,thebasalnucleiarestuck in the indirect pathway, without the direct pathway being activated.
The direct pathway is responsible for increasing cortical movement commands.
The increased activity of the indirect pathway results in the hypokinetic disorder of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
Parkinson‚Äôsdiseaseisneurodegenerative,meaningthatneuronsdiethatcannotbereplaced,sothereisnocurefor thedisorder.TreatmentsforParkinson‚Äôsdiseaseareaimedatincreasingdopaminelevelsinthestriatum.Currently,the most common way of doing that is by providing the amino acid L-DOPA, which is a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier.
With levels of the precursor elevated, the remaining cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta can make more neurotransmitter and have a greater effect.
Unfortunately, the patient will become less responsive to L-DOPA treatment as time progresses, and it can cause increased dopamine levels elsewhere in the brain, which are associated with psychosis or schizophrenia.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 531 Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/parkinsons) for a thorough explanation of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
Compared with the nearest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee, the human has a brain that is huge.
At a point in the past, a common ancestor gave rise to the two species of humans and chimpanzees.
That evolutionary history is long and is still an area of intense study.
But something happened to increase the size of the human brain relative to the chimpanzee.
Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hugebrain) in which the author explores the current understanding of why this happened.
According to one hypothesis about the expansion of brain size, what tissue might have been sacrificed so energy wasavailabletogrowourlargerbrain?Basedonwhatyouknowaboutthattissueandnervoustissue,whywouldthere be a trade-off between them in terms of energy use?
13.3|Circulation and the Central Nervous System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the vessels that supply the CNS with blood ‚Ä¢Name the components of the ventricular system and the regions of the brain in which each is located ‚Ä¢Explain the production of cerebrospinal fluid and its flow through the ventricles ‚Ä¢Explain how a disruption in circulation would result in a stroke The CNS is crucial to the operation of the body, and any compromise in the brain and spinal cord can lead to severe difficulties.
The CNS has a privileged blood supply, as suggested by the blood-brain barrier.
The function of the tissue in the CNS is crucial to the survival of the organism, so the contents of the blood cannot simply pass into the central nervous tissue.
To protect this region from the toxins and pathogens that may be traveling through the blood stream, there is strict controloverwhatcanmoveoutofthegeneralsystemsandintothebrainandspinalcord.Becauseofthisprivilege,theCNS needs specialized structures for the maintenance of circulation.
This begins with a unique arrangement of blood vessels carrying fresh blood into the CNS.
Beyond the supply of blood, the CNS filters that blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is then circulated through the cavities of the brain and spinal cord called ventricles.
Blood Supply to the Brain A lack of oxygen to the CNS can be devastating, and the cardiovascular system has specific regulatory reflexes to ensure that the blood supply is not interrupted.
There are multiple routes for blood to get into the CNS, with specializations to protect that blood supply and to maximize the ability of the brain to get an uninterrupted perfusion.532 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Arterial Supply The major artery carrying recently oxygenated blood away from the heart is the aorta.
The very first branches off the aorta supply the heart with nutrients and oxygen.
The next branches give rise to the common carotid arteries, which further branch into the internal carotid arteries .
The external carotid arteries supply blood to the tissues on the surface of the cranium.Thebasesofthecommoncarotidscontainstretchreceptorsthatimmediatelyrespondtothedropinbloodpressure upon standing.
The orthostatic reflex is a reaction to this change in body position, so that blood pressure is maintained against the increasing effect of gravity (orthostatic means ‚Äústanding up‚Äù).
Heart rate increases‚Äîa reflex of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system‚Äîand this raises blood pressure.
The internal carotid artery enters the cranium through the carotid canal in the temporal bone.
A second set of vessels that supply the CNS are the vertebral arteries , which are protected as they pass through the neck region by the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae.
The vertebral arteries enter the cranium through the foramen magnum of the occipital bone.
Branches off the left and right vertebral arteries merge into the anterior spinal artery supplying the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, found along the anterior median fissure.
The two vertebral arteries then merge into the basilar artery , which gives rise to branches to the brain stem and cerebellum.
The left and right internal carotid arteries and branches of the basilar artery all become the circle of Willis, a confluence of arteries that can maintain perfusion of the brain even if narrowing or a blockage limits flow through one part ( Figure 13.15 ).
Figure 13.15 Circle of Willis The blood supply to the brain enters through the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries, eventually giving rise to the circle of Willis.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 533 Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bloodflow1) to see how blood flows to the brain and passes through the circle of Willis before being distributed through the cerebrum.
The circle of Willis is a specialized arrangement of arteries that ensure constant perfusion of the cerebrum even in the event of a blockage of one of the arteries in the circle.
The animation shows the normal direction of flow through the circle of Willis to the middle cerebral artery.
Where would the blood come from if there were a blockage just posterior to the middle cerebral artery on the left?
Venous Return After passing through the CNS, blood returns to the circulationthrough a series of dural sinuses and veins (Figure 13.16).
Thesuperior sagittal sinus runs in the groove of the longitudinal fissure, where it absorbs CSF from the meninges.
The superiorsagittalsinusdrainstotheconfluenceofsinuses,alongwiththe occipitalsinuses andstraightsinus ,tothendrain into thetransverse sinuses .
The transverse sinuses connect to the sigmoid sinuses , which then connect to the jugular veins.
From there, the blood continues toward the heart to be pumped to the lungs for reoxygenation.
Figure 13.16 Dural Sinuses and Veins Blood drains from the brain through a series of sinuses that connect to the jugular veins.
Protective Coverings of the Brain and Spinal Cord The outer surface of the CNS is covered by a series of membranes composed of connective tissue called the meninges, which protect the brain.
The dura mater is a thick fibrous layer and a strong protective sheath over the entire brain and534 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 spinal cord.
It is anchored to the inner surface of the cranium and vertebral cavity.
The arachnoid mater is a membrane of thin fibrous tissue that forms a loose sac around the CNS.
Beneath the arachnoid is a thin, filamentous mesh called the arachnoid trabeculae , which looks like a spider web, giving this layer its name.
Directly adjacent to the surface of the CNSisthe piamater,athinfibrousmembranethatfollowstheconvolutionsofgyriandsulciinthecerebralcortexandfits into other grooves and indentations ( Figure 13.17 ).
Figure 13.17 Meningeal Layers of Superior Sagittal Sinus The layers of the meninges in the longitudinal fissure of the superior sagittal sinus are shown, with the dura mater adjacent to the inner surface of the cranium, the pia mater adjacent to the surface of the brain, and the arachnoid and subarachnoid space between them.
An arachnoid villus is shown emerging into the dural sinus to allow CSF to filter back into the blood for drainage.
Dura Mater Like a thick cap covering the brain, the dura mater is a tough outer covering.
The name comes from the Latin for ‚Äútough mother‚Äù to represent its physically protective role.
It encloses the entire CNS and the major blood vessels that enter the cranium and vertebral cavity.
It is directly attached to the inner surface of the bones of the cranium and to the very end of the vertebral cavity.
There are infoldings of the dura that fit into large crevasses of the brain.
Two infoldings go through the midline separationsofthecerebrumandcerebellum;oneformsashelf-liketentbetweentheoccipitallobesofthecerebrumandthe cerebellum, and the other surrounds the pituitary gland.
The dura also surrounds and supports the venous sinuses.
Arachnoid Mater The middle layer of the meninges is the arachnoid, named for the spider-web‚Äìlike trabeculae between it and the pia mater.
The arachnoid defines a sac-like enclosure around the CNS.
The trabeculae are found in the subarachnoid space, which is filledwithcirculatingCSF.Thearachnoidemergesintotheduralsinusesasthe arachnoidgranulations,wheretheCSFis filtered back into the blood for drainage from the nervous system.
The subarachnoid space is filled with circulating CSF, which also provides a liquid cushion to the brain and spinal cord.
Similar to clinical blood work, a sample of CSF can be withdrawn to find chemical evidence of neuropathology or metabolic traces of the biochemical functions of nervous tissue.
Pia Mater The outer surface of the CNS is covered in the thin fibrous membrane of the pia mater.
It is thought to have a continuous layer of cells providing a fluid-impermeable membrane.
The name pia mater comes from the Latin for ‚Äútender mother,‚Äù suggesting the thin membrane is a gentle covering for the brain.
The pia extends into every convolution of the CNS, lining the inside of the sulci in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices.
At the end of the spinal cord, a thin filament extends from the inferiorendofCNSattheupperlumbarregionofthevertebralcolumntothesacralendofthevertebralcolumn.Becausethe spinal cord does not extend through the lower lumbar region of the vertebral column, a needle can be inserted through the dura and arachnoid layers to withdraw CSF.
This procedure is called a lumbar puncture and avoids the risk of damaging the central tissue of the spinal cord.
Blood vessels that are nourishing the central nervous tissue are between the pia mater and the nervous tissue.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 535 Meninges Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the three layers of fibrous membrane that surround the CNS.
Meningitis can be caused by infection by bacteria or viruses.
The particular pathogens are not special to meningitis; it is just an inflammation of that specific set of tissues from what might be a broader infection.
Bacterial meningitis canbecausedby Streptococcus ,Staphylococcus ,orthetuberculosispathogen,amongmanyothers.Viralmeningitisis usually the result of common enteroviruses (such as those that cause intestinal disorders), but may be the result of the herpes virus or West Nile virus.
Bacterial meningitis tends to be more severe.
The symptoms associated with meningitis can be fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, soreness of the neck, or severe headache.
More important are the neurological symptoms, such as changes in mental state (confusion, memory deficits, and other dementia-type symptoms).
A serious risk of meningitis can be damage to peripheral structures because of the nerves that pass through the meninges.
Hearing loss is a common result of meningitis.

Why is the lumbar puncture performed in the lower lumbar area of the vertebral column?
The Ventricular System Cerebrospinalfluid(CSF)circulatesthroughoutandaroundtheCNS.Inothertissues,waterandsmallmoleculesarefiltered through capillaries as the major contributor to the interstitial fluid.
In the brain, CSF is produced in special structures to perfuse through the nervous tissue of the CNS and is continuous with the interstitial fluid.
Specifically, CSF circulates to remove metabolic wastes from the interstitial fluids of nervous tissues and return them to the blood stream.
The ventricles aretheopenspaceswithinthebrainwhereCSFcirculates.Insomeofthesespaces,CSFisproducedbyfilteringoftheblood thatisperformedbyaspecializedmembraneknownasachoroidplexus.TheCSFcirculatesthroughalloftheventriclesto eventually emerge into the subarachnoid space where it will be reabsorbed into the blood.
The Ventricles There are four ventricles within the brain, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube, thecentral canal .
The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum.
These ventricles are connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina.
The third ventricle is the space between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into the cerebral aqueduct that passes through the midbrain.Theaqueductopensintothe fourthventricle ,whichisthespacebetweenthecerebellumandtheponsandupper medulla ( Figure 13.18 ).536 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 13.18 Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation The choroid plexus in the four ventricles produce CSF, which is circulated through the ventricular system and then enters the subarachnoid space through the median and lateral apertures.
The CSF is then reabsorbed into the blood at the arachnoid granulations, where the arachnoid membrane emerges into the dural sinuses.
As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within the skull.
The telencephalon is the most anterior region of what was the neural tube, but cannot grow past the limit of the frontal bone of theskull.Becausethecerebrumfitsintothisspace,ittakesonaC-shapedformation,throughthefrontal,parietal,occipital, andfinallytemporalregions.ThespacewithinthetelencephalonisstretchedintothissameC-shape.Thetwoventriclesare in the left and right sides, and were at one time referred to as the first and second ventricles.

The tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roof and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively.
The aqueduct opens up into the fourth ventricle.
The floor of the fourth ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum of the midbrain).
The fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord.
Theventricularsystemopensuptothesubarachnoidspacefromthefourthventricle.Thesingle medianaperture and the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around the outside of the CNS.
Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called achoroid plexus.
Ependymal cells (one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system) surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF.
The fluid is a clear solution with a limited amount of the constituents of blood.
It is essentially water, small molecules, and electrolytes.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved into the CSF, as they are in blood, and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue.
Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation The choroid plexuses are found in all four ventricles.
Observed in dissection, they appear as soft, fuzzy structures that may stillbepink,dependingonhowwellthecirculatorysystemisclearedinpreparationofthetissue.TheCSFisproducedfrom components extracted from the blood, so its flow out of the ventricles is tied to the pulse of cardiovascular circulation.

13.4|The Peripheral Nervous System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the structures found in the PNS ‚Ä¢Distinguish between somatic and autonomic structures, including the special peripheral structures of the enteric nervous system ‚Ä¢Name the twelve cranial nerves and explain the functions associated with each ‚Ä¢Describe the sensory and motor components of spinal nerves and the plexuses that they pass through The PNS is not as contained as the CNS because it is defined as everything that is not the CNS.
Some peripheral structures are incorporated into the other organs of the body.
In describing the anatomy of the PNS, it is necessary to describe the commonstructures,thenervesandtheganglia,astheyarefoundinvariouspartsofthebody.Manyoftheneuralstructures that are incorporated into other organs are features of the digestive system; these structures are known as the enteric nervous system and are a special subset of the PNS.

Under microscopic inspection, it can be seen to include the cell bodies of the neurons, as well as bundles of fibers that are the posterior nerve root (Figure 13.19).
The cells of the dorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them by shape.
Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can be seen surrounding‚Äîas if they were orbiting‚Äîthe neuron cell bodies.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 539 Figure 13.19 Dorsal Root Ganglion The cell bodies of sensory neurons, which are unipolar neurons by shape, are seen in this photomicrograph.
Also, the fibrous region is composed of the axons of these neurons that are passing through the ganglion to be part of the dorsal nerve root (tissue source: canine).

If you zoom in on the dorsal root ganglion, you can see smaller satellite glial cells surrounding the large cell bodies of the sensory neurons.
From what structure do satellite cells derive during embryologic development?
Another type of sensory ganglion is a cranial nerve ganglion.
This is analogous to the dorsal root ganglion, except that it is associated with a cranial nerve instead of a spinal nerve .
The roots of cranial nerves are within the cranium, whereasthegangliaareoutsidetheskull.Forexample,the trigeminalganglion issuperficialtothetemporalbonewhereas its associated nerve is attached to the mid-pons region of the brain stem.
The neurons of cranial nerve ganglia are also unipolar in shape with associated satellite cells.
The other major category of ganglia are those of the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
The sympathetic chain ganglia constitute a row of ganglia along the vertebral column that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord.
Superior to the chain ganglia are three paravertebral ganglia in the cervical region.
Three other autonomic ganglia that are related to the sympathetic chain are the prevertebral ganglia , which are located outside of the chain but have similar functions.
They are referred to as prevertebral because they are anterior to the vertebral column.
The neurons of these autonomic ganglia are multipolar in shape, with dendrites radiating out around the cell body where synapses from the spinal cord neurons are made.
The neurons of the chain, paravertebral, and prevertebral ganglia then project to organs in the head and neck, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities to regulate the sympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms.
Another group of autonomic ganglia are the terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves or sacral spinal nervesandareresponsibleforregulatingtheparasympatheticaspectofhomeostaticmechanisms.Thesetwosetsofganglia, sympathetic and parasympathetic, often project to the same organs‚Äîone input from the chain ganglia and one input from a terminal ganglion‚Äîto regulate the overall function of an organ.
For example, the heart receives two inputs such as these; one increases heart rate, and the other decreases it.
The terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves are found in the head and neck, as well as the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities, whereas the terminal ganglia that receive sacral input are in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavities.
Terminalgangliabelowtheheadandneckareoftenincorporatedintothewallofthetargetorganasa plexus.Aplexus, in a general sense, is a network of fibers or vessels.
This can apply to nervous tissue (as in this instance) or structures containing blood vessels (such as a choroid plexus).
For example, the enteric plexus is the extensive network of axons and neurons in the wall of the small and large intestines.
The enteric plexus is actually part of the enteric nervous system, along with the gastric plexuses and theesophageal plexus.
Though the enteric nervous system receives input originating from central neurons of the autonomic nervous system, it does not require CNS input to function.
In fact, it operates independently to regulate the digestive system.
Nerves Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves.
These structures in the periphery are different than the central counterpart, called a tract.
Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue.
They have connective tissues invested in their structure, as well as blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment.
The outer surface of a nerve is a surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the epineurium.
Within the nerve, axons are further bundled into fascicles,whichareeachsurroundedbytheirownlayeroffibrousconnectivetissuecalled perineurium.Finally,individual axons are surrounded by loose connective tissue called the endoneurium (Figure 13.21).
These three layers are similar to the connective tissue sheaths for muscles.
Nerves are associated with the region of the CNS to which they are connected, either as cranial nerves connected to the brain or spinal nerves connected to the spinal cord.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 541 Figure 13.21 Nerve Structure The structure of a nerve is organized by the layers of connective tissue on the outside, around each fascicle, and surrounding the individual nerve fibers (tissue source: simian).

With what structures in a skeletal muscle are the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium comparable?
Cranial Nerves The nerves attachedto the brain are the cranialnerves, which are primarilyresponsible for the sensory and motor functions oftheheadandneck(oneofthesenervestargetsorgansinthethoracicandabdominalcavitiesaspartoftheparasympathetic nervous system).
There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for ‚ÄúCranial Nerve,‚Äù using Roman numerals for 1 through 12.
They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both, meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the brain stem.
Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus.
Motor axons connect to skeletal muscles of the head or neck.
Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed nerves.
Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to rememberthenervenames.Atraditionalmnemonicistherhymingcouplet,‚ÄúOnOldOlympus‚ÄôToweringTops/AFinnAnd German Viewed Some Hops,‚Äù in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve.Thenamesofthenerveshavechangedovertheyearstoreflectcurrentusageandmoreaccuratenaming.Anexercise to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance.
The names of the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function, their source (sensory ganglion or motor nucleus), and their target (sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle).
They are listed here with a brief explanation of each nerve (Figure 13.23 ).CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 543 Theolfactory nerve andoptic nerve are responsible for the sense of smell and vision, respectively.
The oculomotor nerveis responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the extraocular muscles.
It is also responsible for lifting the upper eyelid when the eyes point up, and for pupillary constriction.
The trochlear nerve and theabducens nerve are both responsible for eye movement, but do so by controlling different extraocular muscles.
The trigeminal nerve is responsible for cutaneoussensations of the faceand controllingthe muscles of mastication.The facialnerve is responsible for the muscles involved in facial expressions, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva.
The vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for the senses of hearing and balance.
The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for controlling muscles in the oral cavity and upper throat, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva.
Thevagus nerve is responsible for contributing to homeostatic control of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.
The spinal accessory nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the neck, along with cervical spinal nerves.
The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the lower throat and tongue.

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/NYTmeningitis) to read about a man who wakes with a headache and a loss of vision.
His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to address the vision loss.
The ophthalmologist recognizes a greater problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room.
Once there, the patient undergoes a large battery of tests, but a definite cause cannot be found.
A specialist recognizes the problem as meningitis, but the question is what caused it originally.
How can that be cured?
The loss of vision comes from swelling around the optic nerve, which probably presented as a bulge on the inside of the eye.
Why is swelling related to meningitis going to push on the optic nerve?544 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Another important aspect of the cranial nerves that lends itself to a mnemonic is the functional role each nerve plays.
The nerves fall into one of three basic groups.
They are sensory, motor, or both (see Table 13.3).
The sentence, ‚ÄúSome Say MarryMoneyButMyBrotherSaysBrainsBeautyMatterMore,‚Äùcorrespondstothebasicfunctionofeachnerve.Thefirst, second, and eighth nerves are purely sensory: the olfactory (CNI), optic (CNII), and vestibulocochlear (CNVIII) nerves.

They are the trigeminal (CNV), facial (CNVII), glossopharyngeal (CNIX), and vagus (CNX) nerves.
The nervesthatconveybothareoftenrelatedtoeachother.Thetrigeminalandfacialnervesbothconcerntheface;oneconcerns the sensations and the other concerns the muscle movements.
The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are both responsible for conveying gustatory, or taste, sensations as well as controlling salivary glands.
The vagus nerve is involved in visceral responses to taste, namely the gag reflex.
This is not an exhaustive list of what these combination nerves do, but there is a thread of relation between them.

The arrangement of these nerves is much more regular than thatofthecranialnerves.Allofthespinalnervesarecombinedsensoryandmotoraxonsthatseparateintotwonerveroots.
The sensory axons enter the spinal cord as the dorsal nerve root.
The motor fibers, both somatic and autonomic, emerge as the ventral nerve root.
The dorsal root ganglion for each nerve is an enlar gement of the spinal nerve.
There are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at which each one emerges.
There are eight pairs of cervical nerves designated C1 to C8, twelve thoracic nerves designated T1 to T12, five pairs of lumbar nerves designated L1 to L5, five pairs of sacral nerves designated S1 to S5, and one pair of coccygeal nerves.
The nerves are numbered from the superior to inferior positions, and each emerges from the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramen at its level.Thefirstnerve,C1,emergesbetweenthefirstcervicalvertebraandtheoccipitalbone.Thesecondnerve,C2,emerges betweenthefirstandsecondcervicalvertebrae.ThesameoccursforC3toC7,butC8emergesbetweentheseventhcervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra.
For the thoracic and lumbar nerves, each one emerges between the vertebra that has the same designation and the next vertebra in the column.
The sacral nerves emerge from the sacral foramina along the length of that unique vertebra.
Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to enervate the periphery.
The nerves in the periphery are not straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow different courses.
Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into a systemic nerve .
This occurs at four places along the length of the vertebral column, each identified as a nerve plexus, whereas the other spinal nerves directly correspond to nerves at their respective levels.
In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe networks of nerve fibers with no associated cell bodies.
Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level (Figure 13.24 ).
Thecervical plexus is composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves in the posterior neck and head, as well as the phrenic nerve, which connects to the diaphragm at the base of the thoracic cavity.
The other plexus from the cervical level is the brachial plexus.
Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through thisplexustogiverisetothenervesofthearms,asthenamebrachialsuggests.Alargenervefromthisplexusisthe radial nervefromwhichthe axillarynerve branchestogotothearmpitregion.Theradialnervecontinuesthroughthearmandis paralleledbythe ulnarnerve andthemediannerve .Thelumbarplexus arisesfromallthelumbarspinalnervesandgives rise to nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg.
The femoral nerve is one of the major nerves from this plexus, which gives rise to the saphenous nerve as a branchthatextendsthrough theanteriorlower leg.The sacralplexus comesfromthelowerlumbarnervesL4andL5andthesacralnervesS1toS4.Themostsignificantsystemicnervetocome from this plexus is the sciatic nerve, which is a combination of the tibial nerve and thefibular nerve .
The sciatic nerve extendsacrossthehipjointandismostcommonlyassociatedwiththecondition sciatica,whichistheresultofcompression or irritation of the nerve or any of the spinal nerves giving rise to it.
These plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving rise to certain systemic nerves, but they contain fibers that serve sensory functions or fibers that serve motor functions.
This means that some fibers extend from cutaneous or other peripheral sensory surfaces and send action potentials into the CNS.
Those are axons of sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia that enter the spinal cord through the dorsal nerve root.
Other fibers are the axons of motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which emerge in the ventral nerve root and send action potentials to cause skeletal muscles to contract in their target regions.
For example, the radial nerve contains fibers of cutaneous sensation in the arm, as well as motor fibers that move muscles in the arm.
Spinalnervesofthethoracicregion,T2throughT11,arenotpartoftheplexusesbutratheremergeandgiverisetothe intercostal nerves found between the ribs, which articulate with the vertebrae surrounding the spinal nerve.546 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 13.24 Nerve Plexuses of the Body There are four main nerve plexuses in the human body.
The cervical plexus supplies nerves to the posterior head and neck, as well as to the diaphragm.
The brachial plexus supplies nerves to the arm.
The lumbar plexus supplies nerves to the anterior leg.
The sacral plexus supplies nerves to the posterior leg.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 547 Nervous System Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell.
It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed, usually because of blunt force trauma to the head.
The sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited lifespan of approximately one to four months, and new ones are made on a regular basis.
The new neurons extend their axons into the CNS by growing along the existingfibers of the olfactorynerve.
The abilityof these neurons to be replacedis lost with age.
Age-related anosmia is not the result of impact trauma to the head, but rather a slow loss of the sensory neurons with no new neurons born to replace them.
Smellisanimportantsense,especiallyfortheenjoymentoffood.Thereareonlyfivetastessensedbythetongue, and two of them are generally thought of as unpleasant tastes (sour and bitter).
The rich sensory experience of food is theresultofodormoleculesassociatedwiththefood,bothasfoodismovedintothemouth,andthereforepassesunder the nose, and when it is chewed and molecules are released to move up the pharynx into the posterior nasal cavity.
Anosmia results in a loss of the enjoyment of food.
As the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can set in.
Without the sense of smell, many sufferers complain of food tasting bland.
Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning that can be sensed on the tongue, which usually means adding table salt.
The problem with this solution, however, is that this increases sodiumintake,whichcanleadtocardiovascularproblemsthroughwaterretentionandtheassociatedincreaseinblood pressure.548 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY

Thedevelopmentofthenervoussystemstartsearlyinembryonicdevelopment.Theouterlayeroftheembryo,theectoderm, gives rise to the skin and the nervous system.
A specialized region of this layer, the neuroectoderm, becomes a groove that foldsinandbecomestheneuraltubebeneaththedorsalsurfaceoftheembryo.Theanteriorendoftheneuraltubedevelops into the brain, and the posterior region becomes the spinal cord.
Tissues at the edges of the neural groove, when it closes off, are called the neural crest and migrate through the embryo to give rise to PNS structures as well as some non-nervous tissues.
Thebraindevelopsfromthisearlytubestructureandgivesrisetospecificregionsoftheadultbrain.Astheneuraltube grows and differentiates, it enlarges into three vesicles that correspond to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions of the adult brain.
Later in development, two of these three vesicles differentiate further, resulting in five vesicles.
Those five vesicles can be aligned with the four major regions of the adult brain.
The cerebrum is formed directly from the telencephalon.
The diencephalon is the only region that keeps its embryonic name.
The mesencephalon, metencephalon, andmyelencephalonbecomethebrainstem.Thecerebellumalsodevelopsfromthemetencephalonandisaseparateregion of the adult brain.
The spinal cord develops out of the rest of the neural tube and retains the tube structure, with the nervous tissue thickening and the hollow center becoming a very small central canal through the cord.
The rest of the hollow center of the neural tube corresponds to open spaces within the brain called the ventricles, where cerebrospinal fluid is found.
13.2 The Central Nervous System The adult brain is separated into four major regions: the cerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum.
The cerebrum is the largest portion and contains the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei.
It is divided into two halves by the longitudinal fissure.
The cortex is separated into the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.
The frontal lobe is responsible for motor functions, from planning movements through executing commands to be sent to the spinal cord and periphery.
The most anterior portion of the frontal lobe is the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with aspects of personality through its influence on motor responses in decision-making.CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 555 The other lobes are responsible for sensory functions.
The parietal lobe is where somatosensation is processed.
The occipital lobe is where visual processing begins, although the other parts of the brain can contribute to visual function.
The temporal lobe contains the cortical area for auditory processing, but also has regions crucial for memory formation.
Nuclei beneath the cerebral cortex, known as the subcortical nuclei, are responsible for augmenting cortical functions.

The limbic system includes deep cerebral nuclei that are responsible for emotion and memory.
The diencephalon includes the thalamus and the hypothalamus, along with some other structures.
The thalamus is a relay between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system.
The hypothalamus coordinates homeostatic functions through the autonomic and endocrine systems.
The brain stem is composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla.
It controls the head and neck region of the body through the cranial nerves.
There are control centers in the brain stem that regulate the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
The cerebellum is connected to the brain stem, primarily at the pons, where it receives a copy of the descending input from the cerebrum to the spinal cord.
It can compare this with sensory feedback input through the medulla and send output through the midbrain that can correct motor commands for coordination.
13.3 Circulation and the Central Nervous System The CNS has a privileged blood supply established by the blood-brain barrier.
Establishing this barrier are anatomical structures that help to protect and isolate the CNS.
The arterial blood to the brain comes from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, which both contribute to the unique circle of Willis that provides constant perfusion of the brain even if one of the blood vessels is blocked or narrowed.
That blood is eventually filtered to make a separate medium, the CSF, that circulates within the spaces of the brain and then into the surrounding space defined by the meninges, the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord.
The blood that nourishes the brain and spinal cord is behind the glial-cell‚Äìenforced blood-brain barrier, which limits the exchange of material from blood vessels with the interstitial fluid of the nervous tissue.
Thus, metabolic wastes are collected in cerebrospinal fluid that circulates through the CNS.
This fluid is produced by filtering blood at the choroid plexusesinthefourventriclesofthebrain.Itthencirculatesthroughtheventriclesandintothesubarachnoidspace,between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater.
From the arachnoid granulations, CSF is reabsorbed into the blood, removing the waste from the privileged central nervous tissue.
The blood, now with the reabsorbed CSF, drains out of the cranium through the dural sinuses.
The dura mater is the tough outer covering of the CNS, which is anchored to the inner surface of the cranial and vertebral cavities.
It surrounds the venous space known as the dural sinuses, which connect to the jugular veins, where blood drains from the head and neck.
13.4 The Peripheral Nervous System The PNS is composed of the groups of neurons (ganglia) and bundles of axons (nerves) that are outside of the brain and spinal cord.
Ganglia are of two types, sensory or autonomic.
Sensory ganglia contain unipolar sensory neurons and are foundonthedorsalrootofallspinalnervesaswellasassociatedwithmanyofthecranialnerves.Autonomicgangliaarein the sympathetic chain, the associated paravertebral or prevertebral ganglia, or in terminal ganglia near or within the organs controlled by the autonomic nervous system.
Nerves are classified as cranial nerves or spinal nerves on the basis of their connection to the brain or spinal cord, respectively.Thetwelvecranialnervescanbestrictlysensoryinfunction,strictlymotorinfunction,oracombinationofthe two functions.
Sensory fibers are axons of sensory ganglia that carry sensory information into the brain and target sensory nuclei.
Motor fibers are axons of motor neurons in motor nuclei of the brain stem and target skeletal muscles of the head andneck.Spinalnervesareallmixednerveswithbothsensoryandmotorfibers.Spinalnervesemergefromthespinalcord andreorganizethroughplexuses,whichthengiverisetosystemicnerves.Thoracicspinalnervesarenotpartofanyplexus, but give rise to the intercostal nerves directly.

As the anterior end of the neural tube develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles that establish the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.
Those structures continue to develop throughout the rest of embryonic development and into adolescence.

As the color changes to blue, the ratio of gray matter to white matter changes.
The caption for the video describes it as ‚Äúless gray matter,‚Äù which is another way of saying ‚Äúmore white matter.‚Äù If the brain does not finish developing until approximately 20 years of age, can teenagers be held responsible for behaving badly?
3.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ basalnuclei1) to learn about the basal nuclei (also known as the basal ganglia), which have two pathways that process information within the cerebrum.
As shown in this video, thedirectpathwayistheshorterpathwaythroughthesystem that results in increased activity in the cerebral cortex and increased motor activity.
The direct pathway is described as resulting in ‚Äúdisinhibition‚Äù of the thalamus.
What does disinhibition mean?
What are the two neurons doing individually to cause this?
4.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ basalnuclei2) to learn about the basal nuclei (also known as the basal ganglia), which have two pathways that process informationwithinthecerebrum.Asshowninthisvideo,the indirect pathway is the longer pathway through the system that results in decreased activity in the cerebral cortex, and therefore less motor activity.
The indirect pathway has an extra couple of connections in it, including disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus.
What is the end result on the thalamus, and therefore on movement initiated by the cerebral cortex?
5.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ graymatter) tolearnaboutthegraymatterofthespinalcord that receives input from fibers of the dorsal (posterior) root and sends information out through the fibers of the ventral (anterior) root.

What are these enlargements responsible for?
6.Compared with the nearest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee, the human has a brain that is huge.
At a point in the past, a common ancestor gave rise to the two species of humans and chimpanzees.
That evolutionary history is long and is still an area of intense study.
But something happened to increase the size of the human brain relative to the chimpanzee.
Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hugebrain) in which the author explores the current understanding of why this happened.According to one hypothesis about the expansion of brain size, what tissue might have been sacrificed so energy was availabletogrowourlargerbrain?Basedonwhatyouknow about that tissue and nervous tissue, why would there be a trade-off between them in terms of energy use?
7.Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ bloodflow1) to see how blood flows to the brain and passes through the circle of Willis before being distributed through the cerebrum.
The circle of Willis is a specialized arrangement of arteries that ensure constant perfusion of the cerebrum even in the event of a blockage of one of the arteries in the circle.
The animation shows the normal direction of flow through the circle of Willis to the middle cerebral artery.
Where would the blood come from if there were a blockage just posterior to the middle cerebral artery on the left?
8.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ lumbarpuncture) thatdescribestheprocedureknownasthe lumbar puncture, a medical procedure used to sample the CSF.

12.Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ NYTmeningitis) to read about a man who wakes with a headache and a loss of vision.
His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to address the vision loss.
The ophthalmologist recognizes a greater problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room.
Once there, the patient undergoes a large battery of tests, but a definite cause cannot be found.
A specialist recognizes the problem as meningitis, but the question is what caused it originally.
How can that be cured?
The loss of vision comes from swelling around the optic nerve, which probably presented as a bulge on the inside of the eye.
Why is swelling related to meningitis going to push on the optic nerve?

Sensory neurons are activated by a stimulus, which is sent to the central nervous system, and a motor response is sent out to the skeletal muscles that control this movement.
Introduction Chapter Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the components of the somatic nervous system ‚Ä¢Name the modalities and submodalities of the sensory systems ‚Ä¢Distinguish between general and special senses ‚Ä¢Describe regions of the central nervous system that contribute to somatic functions ‚Ä¢Explain the stimulus-response motor pathway The somatic nervous system is traditionally considered a division within the peripheral nervous system.
However, this misses an important point: somatic refers to a functional division, whereas peripheral refers to an anatomic division.
The somatic nervous system is responsible for our conscious perception of the environment and for our voluntary responsesCHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 561 to that perception by means of skeletal muscles.
Peripheral sensory neurons receive input from environmental stimuli, but the neurons that produce motor responses originate in the central nervous system.
The distinction between the structures (i.e., anatomy) of the peripheral and central nervous systems and functions (i.e., physiology) of the somatic and autonomic systems can most easily be demonstrated through a simple reflex action.
When you touch a hot stove, you pull your hand away.
Sensory receptors in the skin sense extreme temperature and the early signs of tissue damage.
This triggers an action potential, which travels along the sensory fiber from the skin, through the dorsal spinal root to the spinal cord, and directly activates a ventral horn motor neuron.
That neuron sends a signal along its axon to excite the biceps brachii, causing contraction of the muscle and flexion of the forearm at the elbow to withdraw the hand from the hot stove.
The withdrawal reflex has more components, such as inhibiting the opposing muscle and balancing posture while the arm is forcefully withdrawn, which will be further explored at the end of this chapter .
The basic withdrawal reflex explained above includes sensory input (the painful stimulus), central processing (the synapse in the spinal cord), and motor output (activation of a ventral motor neuron that causes contraction of the biceps brachii).
Expanding the explanation of the withdrawal reflex can include inhibition of the opposing muscle, or cross extension, either of which increase the complexity of the example by involving more central neurons.
A collateral branch ofthesensoryaxonwouldinhibitanotherventralhornmotorneuronsothatthetricepsbrachiidonotcontractandslowthe withdrawal down.
The cross extensor reflex provides a counterbalancing movement on the other side of the body, which requires another collateral of the sensory axon to activate contraction of the extensor muscles in the contralateral limb.
A more complex example of somatic function is conscious muscle movement.
For example, reading of this text starts with visual sensory input to the retina, which then projects to the thalamus, and on to the cerebral cortex.
A sequence of regions of the cerebral cortex process the visual information, starting in the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobe, and resulting in the conscious perception of these letters.
Subsequent cognitive processing results in understanding of the content.
As you continue reading, regions of the cerebral cortex in the frontal lobe plan how to move the eyes to follow the lines of text.
The output from the cortex causes activity in motor neurons in the brain stem that cause movement of the extraocularmusclesthroughthethird,fourth,andsixthcranialnerves.Thisexamplealsoincludessensoryinput(theretinal projectiontothethalamus),centralprocessing(thethalamusandsubsequentcorticalactivity),andmotoroutput(activation of neurons in the brain stem that lead to coordinated contraction of extraocular muscles).
14.1|Sensory Perception By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe different types of sensory receptors ‚Ä¢Describe the structures responsible for the special senses of taste, smell, hearing, balance, and vision ‚Ä¢Distinguish how different tastes are transduced ‚Ä¢Describe the means of mechanoreception for hearing and balance ‚Ä¢List the supporting structures around the eye and describe the structure of the eyeball ‚Ä¢Describe the processes of phototransduction A major role of sensory receptors is to help us learn about the environment around us, or about the state of our internal environment.Stimulifromvaryingsources,andofdifferenttypes,arereceivedandchangedintotheelectrochemicalsignals ofthenervoussystem.Thisoccurswhenastimuluschangesthecellmembranepotentialofasensoryneuron.Thestimulus causes the sensory cell to produce an action potential that is relayed into the central nervous system (CNS), where it is integratedwithothersensoryinformation‚Äîorsometimeshighercognitivefunctions‚Äîtobecomeaconsciousperceptionof that stimulus.
The central integration may then lead to a motor response.

Perception is dependent on sensation, but not all sensations are perceived.
Receptors are the cells or structures that detectsensations.Areceptorcellischangeddirectlybyastimulus.Atransmembraneproteinreceptorisaproteininthecell membrane that mediates a physiological change in a neuron, most often through the opening of ion channels or changes in the cell signaling processes.
Transmembrane receptors are activated by chemicals called ligands.
For example, a molecule in food can serve as a ligand for taste receptors.
Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors, are sensitive to mechanical or thermal changes.
Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane, and can generate an action potential or a graded potential in the sensory neurons.
Sensory Receptors Stimuli in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the peripheral nervous system.
Different types of stimuli are sensed by different types of receptor cells.
Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different criteria: cell type, position, and function.
Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position inrelationtostimulitheysense.Theycanalsobeclassifiedfunctionallyonthebasisofthe transduction ofstimuli,orhow the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell membrane potential.562 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Structural Receptor Types The cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a neuron that has a free nerve ending, with dendrites embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the sensorynerveendingsareencapsulatedinconnectivetissuethatenhancestheirsensitivity;or(3)aspecialized receptorcell, which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus (Figure 14.2).
The pain and temperature receptors in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings.
Also located in the dermis of the skinarelamellatedcorpuscles,neuronswithencapsulatednerveendingsthatrespondtopressureandtouch.Thecellsinthe retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor , aphotoreceptor.
Figure 14.2 Receptor Classification by Cell Type Receptor cell types can be classified on the basis of their structure.
Sensory neurons can have either (a) free nerve endings or (b) encapsulated endings.
Photoreceptors in the eyes, such as rod cells, are examples of (c) specialized receptor cells.
These cells release neurotransmitters onto a bipolar cell, which then synapses with the optic nerve neurons.
Another way that receptors can be classified is based on their location relative to the stimuli.
An exteroceptor is a receptor that is located near a stimulus in the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in the skin.
An interoceptor is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the increase in blood pressure in the aorta or carotid sinus.
Finally, a proprioceptor is a receptor located near a moving part of the body, such as a muscle, that interprets the positions of the tissues as they move.
Functional Receptor Types A third classification of receptors is by how the receptor transduces stimuli into membrane potential changes.
Stimuli are of three general types.
Some stimuli are ions and macromolecules that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane.
Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials.
Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light.
For humans, the only electromagneticenergythatisperceivedbyoureyesisvisiblelight.Someotherorganismshavereceptorsthathumanslack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.
Receptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce.
Chemical stimuli can be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object‚Äôs taste or smell.
Osmoreceptors respondtosoluteconcentrationsofbodyfluids.Additionally,painisprimarilyachemicalsensethatinterpretsthepresence of chemicals from tissue damage, or similar intense stimuli, through a nociceptor.
Physical stimuli, such as pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor .
Another physical stimulus that has its own type of receptor is temperature, which is sensed through a thermoreceptor that is either sensitive to temperatures above (heat) or below (cold) normal body temperature.
Sensory Modalities Ask anyone what the senses are, and they are likely to list the five major senses‚Äîtaste, smell, touch, hearing, and sight.
However, these are not all of the senses.
The most obvious omission from this list is balance.
Also, what is referred to simply as touch can be further subdivided into pressure, vibration, stretch, and hair-follicle position, on the basis of the type of mechanoreceptors that perceive these touch sensations.
Other overlooked senses include temperature perception by thermoreceptors and pain perception by nociceptors.
Within the realm of physiology, senses can be classified as either general or specific.
A general sense is one that is distributed throughout the body and has receptor cells within the structures of other organs.
Mechanoreceptors in the skin, muscles, or the walls of blood vessels are examples of this type.
General senses often contribute to the sense of touch, as described above, or to proprioception (body movement) and kinesthesia (body movement), or to a visceral sense, whichCHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 563 is most important to autonomic functions.
A special sense is one that has a specific organ devoted to it, namely the eye, inner ear, tongue, or nose.
Eachof the senses is referredto as a sensory modality.
Modalityrefers to the way thatinformationis encoded,which is similar to the idea of transduction.
The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced.
The chemical senses are taste and smell.
The general sense that is usually referred to as touch includes chemical sensation in the form of nociception, or pain.
Pressure, vibration, muscle stretch, and the movement of hair by an external stimulus, are all sensed by mechanoreceptors.
Hearing and balance are also sensed by mechanoreceptors.
Finally, vision involves the activation of photoreceptors.
Listing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the five major senses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense.
An individual sensory modality represents the sensation of a specific type of stimulus.
For example, the general sense of touch, which is known as somatosensation , can be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair movement.
Gustation (Taste) Only a few recognized submodalities exist within the sense of taste, or gustation.
Until recently, only four tastes were recognized:sweet,salty,sour,andbitter.Researchattheturnofthe20thcenturyledtorecognitionofthefifthtaste,umami, duringthemid-1980s.
UmamiisaJapanesewordthatmeans‚Äúdelicioustaste,‚Äùandisoftentranslatedtomeansavory.Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste for fats, or lipids.
Gustation is the special sense associated with the tongue.
The surface of the tongue, along with the rest of the oral cavity,islinedbyastratifiedsquamousepithelium.Raisedbumpscalled papillae(singular=papilla)containthestructures for gustatorytransduction.Therearefour types of papillae,based on theirappearance(Figure 14.3): circumvallate,foliate, filiform, and fungiform.
Within the structure of the papillae are taste buds that contain specialized gustatory receptor cellsfor the transduction of taste stimuli.
These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release neurotransmitters based on the amount of the chemical in the food.
Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate sensory neurons in the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves.
Figure 14.3 The Tongue The tongue is covered with small bumps, called papillae, which contain taste buds that are sensitive to chemicals in ingested food or drink.
Different types of papillae are found in different regions of the tongue.
The taste buds contain specialized gustatory receptor cells that respond to chemical stimuli dissolved in the saliva.
These receptor cells activate sensory neurons that are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves.

When you eat something salty, the salt crystals dissociate into the component ions Na+and Cl‚Äì, which dissolve into the saliva in your mouth.
The Na+concentration becomeshighoutsidethegustatorycells,creatingastrongconcentrationgradientthatdrivesthediffusionoftheionintothe cells.
The entry of Na+into these cells results in the depolarization of the cell membrane and the generation of a receptor potential.
Sour taste is the perception of H+concentration.
Just as with sodium ions in salty flavors, these hydrogen ions enter thecellandtriggerdepolarization.Sourflavorsare,essentially,theperceptionofacidsinourfood.Increasinghydrogenion concentrationsinthesaliva(loweringsalivapH)triggersprogressivelystrongergradedpotentialsinthegustatorycells.For example,orangejuice‚Äîwhichcontainscitricacid‚ÄîwilltastesourbecauseithasapHvalueofapproximately3.Ofcourse, it is often sweetened so that the sour taste is masked.
The first two tastes (salty and sour) are triggered by the cations Na+and H+.
The other tastes result from food molecules binding to a G protein‚Äìcoupled receptor.
A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to depolarization of the gustatory cell.
The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of glucose dissolvedinthesaliva.Othermonosaccharidessuchasfructose,orartificialsweetenerssuchasaspartame(NutraSweet‚Ñ¢), saccharine, or sucralose (Splenda‚Ñ¢) also activate the sweet receptors.
The affinity for each of these molecules varies, and some will taste sweeter than glucose because they bind to the G protein‚Äìcoupled receptor dif ferently.
BittertasteissimilartosweetinthatfoodmoleculesbindtoGprotein‚Äìcoupledreceptors.However,thereareanumber of different ways in which this can happen because there are a large diversity of bitter-tasting molecules.
Some bitter moleculesdepolarizegustatorycells,whereasothershyperpolarizegustatorycells.Likewise,somebittermoleculesincrease G protein activation within the gustatory cells, whereas other bitter molecules decrease G protein activation.
The specific response depends on which molecule is binding to the receptor.
One major group of bitter-tasting molecules are alkaloids.
Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing molecules that often have a basic pH.
Alkaloids are commonly found in bitter-tasting plant products, such as coffee, hops (in beer), tannins (in wine), tea, and aspirin.
By containing toxic alkaloids, the plant is less susceptible to microbe infection and less attractive to herbivores.
Therefore,thefunctionofbittertastemayprimarilyberelatedtostimulatingthegagreflextoavoidingestingpoisons.
Because of this, many bitter foods that are normally ingested are often combined with a sweet component to make them more palatable (cream and sugar in coffee, for example).
The highest concentration of bitter receptors appear to be in the posterior tongue, where a gag reflex could still spit out poisonous food.
Thetasteknownasumamiisoftenreferredtoasthesavorytaste.Likesweetandbitter,itisbasedontheactivationof Gprotein‚Äìcoupledreceptorsbyaspecificmolecule.ThemoleculethatactivatesthisreceptoristheaminoacidL-glutamate.
Therefore, the umami flavor is often perceived while eating protein-rich foods.
Not surprisingly, dishes that contain meat are often described as savory.
Once the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release neurotransmitters onto the dendrites of sensory neurons.
These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within the vagus nerve dedicated to the gag reflex.
The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue.
The glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue.
The vagus nerve connects to taste buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the pharynx, which are more sensitive to noxious stimuli such as bitterness.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 565 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/DanielleReed) to learn about Dr. Danielle Reed of the Monell ChemicalSensesCenterinPhiladelphia,Pennsylvania,whobecameinterestedinscienceatanearlyagebecauseofher sensory experiences.
She recognized that her sense of taste was unique compared with other people she knew.
Now, she studies the genetic differences between people and their sensitivities to taste stimuli.
In the video, there is a brief image of a person sticking out their tongue, which has been covered with a colored dye.
This is how Dr. Reed is able to visualize and count papillae on the surface of the tongue.

Olfaction (Smell) Liketaste,thesenseofsmell,or olfaction,isalsoresponsivetochemicalstimuli.Theolfactoryreceptorneuronsarelocated in a small region within the superior nasal cavity ( Figure 14.4 ).
This region is referred to as the olfactory epithelium and contains bipolar sensory neurons.
Each olfactory sensory neuron has dendrites that extend from the apical surface of the epitheliumintothemucusliningthecavity.Asairbornemoleculesareinhaledthroughthenose,theypassovertheolfactory epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus.
These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites.
The odorant‚Äìprotein complex binds to a receptor protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite.
These receptors are G protein‚Äìcoupled, and will produce a graded membrane potential in the olfactory neurons.
The axon of an olfactory neuron extends from the basal surface of the epithelium, through an olfactory foramen in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and into the brain.
The group of axons called the olfactory tract connect to the olfactorybulb ontheventralsurfaceofthefrontallobe.Fromthere,theaxonssplittotraveltoseveralbrainregions.Some travel to the cerebrum, specifically to the primary olfactory cortex that is located in the inferior and medial areas of the temporal lobe.
Others project to structures within the limbic system and hypothalamus, where smells become associated with long-term memory and emotional responses.
This is how certain smells trigger emotional memories, such as the smell of food associated with one‚Äôs birthplace.
Smell is the one sensory modality that does not synapse in the thalamus before connecting to the cerebral cortex.
This intimate connection between the olfactory system and the cerebral cortex is one reason why smell can be a potent trigger of memories and emotion.
Thenasalepithelium,includingtheolfactorycells,canbeharmedbyairbornetoxicchemicals.Therefore,theolfactory neurons are regularly replaced within the nasal epithelium, after which the axons of the new neurons must find their appropriateconnectionsintheolfactorybulb.Thesenewaxonsgrowalongtheaxonsthatarealreadyinplaceinthecranial nerve.566 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure14.4TheOlfactorySystem (a) The olfactory system begins in the peripheral structures of the nasal cavity.
(b) The olfactory receptor neurons are within the olfactory epithelium.
(c) Axons of the olfactory receptor neurons project through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and synapse with the neurons of the olfactory bulb (tissue source: simian).
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) Olfactory System: Anosmia Blunt force trauma to the face, such as that common in many car accidents, can lead to the loss of the olfactory nerve, and subsequently, loss of the sense of smell.
This condition is known as anosmia.
When the frontal lobe of the brain moves relative to the ethmoid bone, the olfactory tract axons may be sheared apart.
Professional fighters often experience anosmia because of repeated trauma to face and head.
In addition, certain pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics,cancauseanosmiabykillingalltheolfactoryneuronsatonce.Ifnoaxonsareinplacewithintheolfactory nerve, then the axons from newly formed olfactory neurons have no guide to lead them to their connections within the olfactory bulb.
There are temporary causes of anosmia, as well, such as those caused by inflammatory responses related to respiratory infections or allergies.
Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland.
A person with an impaired sense of smell may require additionalspice and seasoning levelsfor food to be tasted.Anosmia may also be relatedto some presentationsof mild depression, because the loss of enjoyment of food may lead to a general sense of despair .
The ability of olfactory neurons to replace themselves decreases with age, leading to age-related anosmia.

The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the auricle.
Some sources will also refer to this structure as the pinna, though that term is more appropriate for a structure that can be moved, such as the external ear of a cat.
The C-shaped curves of the auricle direct sound waves toward the auditory canal.
The canal enterstheskullthroughtheexternalauditorymeatusofthetemporalbone.Attheendoftheauditorycanalisthe tympanic membrane, or ear drum, which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves.
The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane are often referred to as the external ear .
Themiddle ear consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the ossicles.
The three ossicles are the malleus, incus, and stapes, which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer, anvil, and stirrup.
The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus.
The incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes.
The stapes is then attached to the inner ear , where the sound waves will be transduced into a neural signal.
The middle ear is connected to the pharynx through the Eustachian tube, which helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane.
The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract during swallowing or yawning.
Figure 14.5 Structures of the Ear The external ear contains the auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane.
The middle ear contains the ossicles and is connected to the pharynx by the Eustachian tube.
The inner ear contains the cochlea and vestibule, which are responsible for audition and equilibrium, respectively .
The inner ear is often described as a bony labyrinth, as it is composed of a series of canals embedded within the temporal bone.
It has two separate regions, the cochleaand thevestibule, which are responsible for hearing and balance, respectively.
The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber bundles.
However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve.
Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which contains the sensory neurons of thespiral ganglia.
These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of the inner ear.
The cochlea is attached to the stapes through the oval window.
The oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli.
The scalavestibuliextendsfromtheovalwindow,travellingabovethe cochlearduct,whichisthecentralcavityofthecochlea that contains the sound-transducing neurons.
At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves over the top of thecochlearduct.Thefluid-filledtube,nowcalledthe scalatympani ,returnstothebaseofthecochlea,thistimetravelling under the cochlear duct.
The scala tympani ends at the round window, which is covered by a membrane that contains the fluid within the scala.
As vibrations of the ossicles travel through the oval window, the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani moves in a wave-like motion.
The frequency of the fluid waves match the frequencies of the sound waves (Figure 14.6).
The membrane covering the round window will bulge out or pucker in with the movement of the fluid within the scala tympani.568 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 14.6 Transmission of Sound Waves to Cochlea A sound wave causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate.
This vibration is amplified as it moves across the malleus, incus, and stapes.
The amplified vibration is picked up by the oval window causing pressure waves in the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani.
The complexity of the pressure waves is determined by the changes in amplitude and frequency of the sound waves entering the ear .
A cross-sectional view of the cochlea shows that the scala vestibuli and scala tympani run along both sides of the cochlear duct (Figure 14.7).
The cochlear duct contains several organs of Corti, which tranduce the wave motion of the twoscalaintoneuralsignals.TheorgansofCortilieontopofthe basilarmembrane,whichisthesideofthecochlearduct located between the organs of Corti and the scala tympani.
As the fluid waves move through the scala vestibuli and scala tympani,thebasilarmembranemovesataspecificspot,dependingonthefrequencyofthewaves.Higherfrequencywaves move the region of the basilar membrane that is close to the base of the cochlea.
Lower frequency waves move the region of the basilar membrane that is near the tip of the cochlea.
Figure 14.7 Cross Section of the Cochlea The three major spaces within the cochlea are highlighted.
The scala tympani and scala vestibuli lie on either side of the cochlear duct.
The organ of Corti, containing the mechanoreceptor hair cells, is adjacent to the scala tympani, where it sits atop the basilar membrane.
The organs of Corti contain hair cells , which are named for the hair-like stereocilia extending from the cell‚Äôs apical surfaces (Figure 14.8).
The stereocilia are an array of microvilli-like structures arranged from tallest to shortest.
Protein fibers tether adjacent hairs together within each array, such that the array will bend in response to movements of the basilarCHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 569 membrane.
The stereocilia extend up from the hair cells to the overlying tectorial membrane, which is attached medially to the organ of Corti.
When the pressure waves from the scala move the basilar membrane, the tectorial membrane slides across the stereocilia.
This bends the stereocilia either toward or away from the tallest member of each array.
When the stereocilia bend toward the tallest member of their array, tension in the protein tethers opens ion channels in the hair cell membrane.Thiswilldepolarizethehaircellmembrane,triggeringnerveimpulsesthattraveldowntheafferentnervefibers attached to the hair cells.
When the stereocilia bend toward the shortest member of their array, the tension on the tethers slackens and the ion channels close.
When no sound is present, and the stereocilia are standing straight, a small amount of tension still exists on the tethers, keeping the membrane potential of the hair cell slightly depolarized.
Figure 14.8 Hair Cell The hair cell is a mechanoreceptor with an array of stereocilia emerging from its apical surface.
The stereocilia are tethered together by proteins that open ion channels when the array is bent toward the tallest member of their array, and closed when the array is bent toward the shortest member of their array.

The basilar membrane is the thin membrane that extends from the central core of the cochlea to the edge.
What is anchored to this membrane so that they can be activated by movement of the fluids within the cochlea?
As stated above, a given region of the basilar membrane will only move if the incoming sound is at a specific frequency.
Because the tectorial membrane only moves where the basilar membrane moves, the hair cells in this region will also only respond to sounds of this specific frequency.
Therefore, as the frequency of a sound changes, different hair cells are activated all along the basilar membrane.
The cochlea encodes auditory stimuli for frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz, which is the range of sound that human ears can detect.
The unit of Hertz measures the frequency of sound waves in terms of cycles produced per second.
Frequencies as low as 20 Hz are detected by hair cells at the apex, or tip, of the cochlea.
Frequencies in the higher ranges of 20 KHz are encoded by hair cells at the base of the cochlea, close to the round and oval windows (Figure 14.10).
Most auditory stimuli contain a mixture of sounds at a variety of frequencies and intensities(representedbytheamplitudeofthesoundwave).Thehaircellsalongthelengthofthecochlearduct,whichare eachsensitivetoaparticularfrequency,allowthecochleatoseparateauditorystimulibyfrequency,justasaprismseparates visible light into its component colors.
Figure 14.10 Frequency Coding in the Cochlea The standing sound wave generated in the cochlea by the movement of the oval window deflects the basilar membrane on the basis of the frequency of sound.
Therefore, hair cells at the base of the cochlea are activated only by high frequencies, whereas those at the apex of the cochlea are activated only by low frequencies.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 571 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ear1) to learn more about how the structures of the ear convert sound wavesintoaneuralsignalbymovingthe‚Äúhairs,‚Äùorstereocilia,ofthecochlearduct.Specificlocationsalongthelength of the duct encode specific frequencies, or pitches.

Equilibrium (Balance) Along with audition, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium, the sense of balance.
A similar mechanoreceptor‚Äîa hair cell with stereocilia‚Äîsenses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are in motion.
These cells are located within the vestibule of the inner ear.
Head position is sensed by the utricleandsaccule, whereasheadmovementissensedbythe semicircularcanals .Theneuralsignalsgeneratedinthe vestibularganglion are transmitted through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem and cerebellum.

The difference in inertia between the hair cell stereocilia and the otolith in which they are embedded leads to a shearing force that causes the stereocilia to bend in the direction of that linear acceleration.
Thesemicircularcanalsarethreering-likeextensionsofthevestibule.Oneisorientedinthehorizontalplane,whereas the other two are oriented in the vertical plane.
The anterior and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately 45 degrees relative to the sagittal plane (Figure 14.12).
The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the vestibule, connects to an enlarged region known as the ampulla.
The ampulla contains the hair cells that respond to rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying ‚Äúno.‚Äù The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the cupula, a membrane that attaches to the top of the ampulla.
As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement.
The semicircular canals contain several ampullae, with some oriented horizontally and others oriented vertically.
By comparing the relative movements of both the horizontal and vertical ampullae, the vestibular system can detect the direction of most head movements within three- dimensional (3-D) space.
Figure 14.12 Rotational Coding by Semicircular Canals Rotational movement of the head is encoded by the hair cells in the base of the semicircular canals.
As one of the canals moves in an arc with the head, the internal fluid moves in the opposite direction, causing the cupula and stereocilia to bend.
The movement of two canals within a plane results in information about the direction in which the head is moving, and activation of all six canals can give a very precise indication of head movement in three dimensions.
Somatosensation (Touch) Somatosensationisconsideredageneralsense,asopposedtothespecialsensesdiscussedinthissection.Somatosensationis the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch, proprioception, and interoception.
These modalities includeCHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 573 pressure,vibration,lighttouch,tickle,itch,temperature,pain,proprioception,andkinesthesia.Thismeansthatitsreceptors are not associated with a specialized organ, but are instead spread throughout the body in a variety of organs.
Many of the somatosensory receptors are located in the skin, but receptors are also found in muscles, tendons, joint capsules, ligaments, and in the walls of visceral organs.
Two types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by free nerve endings are pain and temperature.
These two modalities use thermoreceptors and nociceptors to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively.
Temperature receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from body temperature.
Some thermoreceptors are sensitive to just cold and others to just heat.
Nociception is the sensation of potentially damaging stimuli.
Mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations.
Stressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate receptor proteins in the nociceptors.
For example, the sensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves capsaicin, the active molecule in hot peppers.
Capsaicin molecules bind to a transmembrane ion channel in nociceptors that is sensitive to temperatures above 37¬∞C.
The dynamics of capsaicin binding with this transmembrane ion channel is unusual in that the moleculeremainsboundforalongtime.Becauseofthis,itwilldecreasetheabilityofotherstimulitoelicitpainsensations through the activated nociceptor.
For this reason, capsaicin can be used as a topical analgesic, such as in products such as Icy Hot‚Ñ¢.

Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini corpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.
Othersomatosensoryreceptorsarefoundinthejointsandmuscles.Stretchreceptorsmonitorthestretchingoftendons, muscles, and the components of joints.
For example, have you ever stretched your muscles before or after exercise and noticed that you can only stretch so far before your muscles spasm back to a less stretched state?
This spasm is a reflex that is initiated by stretch receptors to avoid muscle tearing.
Such stretch receptors can also prevent over-contraction of a muscle.
In skeletal muscle tissue, these stretch receptors are called muscle spindles.
Golgi tendon organs similarly transduce the stretch levels of tendons.
Bulbous corpuscles are also present in joint capsules, where they measure stretch in the components of the skeletal system within the joint.
The types of nerve endings, their locations, and the stimuli they transduce are presented in Table 14.1.

The inner surface of each lid is a thin membrane known as the palpebral conjunctiva.
The conjunctiva extends over the white areas of the eye (the sclera), connecting the eyelids to the eyeball.

Figure 14.13 The Eye in the Orbit The eye is located within the orbit and surrounded by soft tissues that protect and support its function.
The orbit is surrounded by cranial bones of the skull.
Movement of the eye within the orbit is accomplished by the contraction of six extraocular muscles that originate from the bones of the orbit and insert into the surface of the eyeball (Figure 14.14).
Four of the muscles are arranged at thecardinalpointsaroundtheeyeandarenamedforthoselocations.Theyarethe superiorrectus, medialrectus, inferior rectus, and lateral rectus.
When each of these muscles contract, the eye to moves toward the contracting muscle.
For example, when the superior rectus contracts, the eye rotates to look up.
The superior oblique originates at the posterior orbit, near the origin of the four rectus muscles.
However, the tendon of the oblique muscles threads through a pulley-like piece of cartilage known as the trochlea.
The tendon inserts obliquely into the superior surface of the eye.
The angle of the tendon through the trochlea means that contraction of the superior oblique rotates the eye medially.
The inferior oblique muscleoriginatesfromtheflooroftheorbitandinsertsintotheinferolateralsurfaceoftheeye.Whenitcontracts,itlaterally rotates the eye, in opposition to the superior oblique.
Rotation of the eye by the two oblique muscles is necessary because the eye is not perfectly aligned on the sagittal plane.
When the eye looks up or down, the eye must also rotate slightly to compensate for the superior rectus pulling at approximately a 20-degree angle, rather than straight up.

The extraocular muscles are innervated by three cranial nerves.

The eye itself is a hollow sphere composed of three layers of tissue.
The outermost layer is the fibrous tunic , which includesthewhite scleraandclear cornea.Thescleraaccountsforfivesixthsofthesurfaceoftheeye,mostofwhichisnot visible, though humans are unique compared with many other species in having so much of the ‚Äúwhite of the eye‚Äù visible (Figure 14.15 ).
The transparent cornea covers the anterior tip of the eye and allows light to enter the eye.
The middle layer of the eye is the vascular tunic, which is mostly composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris.
The choroidis a layer of highly vascularized connective tissue that provides a blood supply to the eyeball.
The choroid is posterior to the ciliary body, a muscular structure that is attached to the lensbyzonule fibers .
These two structures bend the lens, allowing it to focuslightonthebackoftheeye.Overlayingtheciliarybody,andvisibleintheanterioreye,isthe iris‚Äîthecoloredpartof theeye.Theirisisasmoothmusclethatopensorclosesthe pupil,whichistheholeatthecenteroftheeyethatallowslight to enter.
Theiris constrictsthepupilin response to brightlightand dilatesthepupilin response to dimlight.Theinnermost layer of the eye is the neural tunic, or retina, which contains the nervous tissue responsible for photoreception.
The eye is also divided into two cavities: the anterior cavity and the posterior cavity.
The anterior cavity is the space between the cornea and lens, including the iris and ciliary body.
It is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humor.
The posterior cavity is the space behind the lens that extends to the posterior side of the interior eyeball, where the retina is located.
The posterior cavity is filled with a more viscous fluid called the vitreous humor.
The retina is composed of several layers and contains specialized cells for the initial processing of visual stimuli.

The axons of RGCs, which lie at the innermost layer of the retina, collect at the optic disc and leave the eye as the optic nerve(seeFigure 14.15).
Because these axons pass through the retina, there are no photoreceptors at the very back of the eye, where the optic nerve begins.
This creates a ‚Äúblind spot‚Äù in the retina, and a corresponding blind spot in our visual field.576 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 14.15 Structure of the Eye The sphere of the eye can be divided into anterior and posterior chambers.
The wall of the eye is composed of three layers: the fibrous tunic, vascular tunic, and neural tunic.
Within the neural tunic is the retina, with three layers of cells and two synaptic layers in between.
The center of the retina has a small indentation known as the fovea.
Notethatthephotoreceptorsintheretina(rodsandcones)arelocatedbehindtheaxons,RGCs,bipolarcells,andretinal blood vessels.
A significant amount of light is absorbed by these structures before the light reaches the photoreceptor cells.
However, at the exact center of the retina is a small area known as the fovea.
At the fovea, the retina lacks the supporting cellsandbloodvessels,andonlycontainsphotoreceptors.Therefore, visualacuity,orthesharpnessofvision,isgreatestat the fovea.
This is because the fovea is where the least amount of incoming light is absorbed by other retinal structures (see Figure 14.15).
As one moves in either direction from this central point of the retina, visual acuity drops significantly.
In addition, each photoreceptor cell of the fovea is connected to a single RGC.
Therefore, this RGC does not have to integrate inputs from multiple photoreceptors, which reduces the accuracy of visual transduction.
Toward the edges of the retina, severalphotoreceptorsconvergeonRGCs(throughthebipolarcells)uptoaratioof50to1.Thedifferenceinvisualacuity between the fovea and peripheral retina is easily evidenced by looking directly at a word in the middle of this paragraph.
The visual stimulus in the middle of the field of view falls on the fovea and is in the sharpest focus.
Without moving your eyesoffthatword,noticethatwordsatthebeginningorendoftheparagrapharenotinfocus.Theimagesinyourperipheral vision are focused by the peripheral retina, and have vague, blurry edges and words that are not as clearly identified.
As a result, a large part of the neural function of the eyes is concerned with moving the eyes and head so that important visual stimuli are centered on the fovea.
Light falling on the retina causes chemical changes to pigment molecules in the photoreceptors, ultimately leading to a change in the activity of the RGCs.
Photoreceptor cells have two parts, the inner segment and theouter segment (Figure 14.16).
The inner segment contains the nucleus and other common organelles of a cell, whereas the outer segment isaspecializedregioninwhichphotoreceptiontakesplace.Therearetwotypesofphotoreceptors‚Äîrodsandcones‚Äîwhich differ in the shape of their outer segment.
The rod-shaped outer segments of the rod photoreceptor contain a stack of membrane-bound discs that contain the photosensitive pigment rhodopsin.
The cone-shaped outer segments of the cone photoreceptor contain their photosensitive pigments in infoldings of the cell membrane.
There are three cone photopigments, called opsins, which are each sensitive to a particular wavelength of light.
The wavelength of visible light determines its color.
The pigments in human eyes are specialized in perceiving three different primary colors: red, green, and blue.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 577 Figure 14.16 Photoreceptor (a) All photoreceptors have inner segments containing the nucleus and other important organelles and outer segments with membrane arrays containing the photosensitive opsin molecules.
Rod outer segments are long columnar shapes with stacks of membrane-bound discs that contain the rhodopsin pigment.
Cone outer segments are short, tapered shapes with folds of membrane in place of the discs in the rods.
(b) Tissue of the retina shows a dense layer of nuclei of the rods and cones.
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) At the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell.
A single unit of light is called a photon, which is described in physics as a packet of energy with properties of both a particle and a wave.
The energy of a photon is represented by its wavelength, with each wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular color.
Visible light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between380and720nm.Longerwavelengthsoflessthan380nmfallintotheinfraredrange,whereasshorterwavelengths of more than 720 nm fall into the ultraviolet range.
Light with a wavelength of 380 nm is blue whereas light with a wavelength of 720 nm is dark red.
All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.
Opsinpigmentsareactuallytransmembraneproteinsthatcontainacofactorknownas retinal.Retinalisahydrocarbon molecule related to vitamin A.
When a photon hits retinal, the long hydrocarbon chain of the molecule is biochemically altered.
Specifically, photons cause some of the double-bonded carbons within the chain to switch from a cisto atrans578 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 conformation.Thisprocessiscalled photoisomerization.Beforeinteractingwithaphoton,retinal‚Äôsflexibledouble-bonded carbons are in the cisconformation.
This molecule is referred to as 11-cis -retinal.
A photon interacting with the molecule causes the flexible double-bonded carbons to change to the trans- conformation, forming all-trans-retinal, which has a straight hydrocarbon chain ( Figure 14.17 ).
Theshapechangeofretinalinthephotoreceptorsinitiatesvisualtransductionintheretina.Activationofretinalandthe opsin proteins result in activation of a G protein.
The G protein changes the membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell, which then releases less neurotransmitter into the outer synaptic layer of the retina.
Until the retinal molecule is changed back to the 11-cis-retinal shape, the opsin cannot respond to light energy, which is called bleaching.
When a large group of photopigments is bleached, the retina will send information as if opposing visual information is being perceived.
After a bright flash of light, afterimages are usually seen in negative.
The photoisomerization is reversed by a series of enzymatic changes so that the retinal responds to more light energy.
Figure 14.17 Retinal Isomers The retinal molecule has two isomers, (a) one before a photon interacts with it and (b) one that is altered through photoisomerization.
Theopsinsaresensitivetolimitedwavelengthsoflight.Rhodopsin,thephotopigmentinrods,ismostsensitivetolight at a wavelength of 498 nm.
The three color opsins have peak sensitivities of 564 nm, 534 nm, and 420 nm corresponding roughlytotheprimarycolorsofred,green,andblue(Figure14.18).Theabsorbanceofrhodopsinintherodsismuchmore sensitive than in the cone opsins; specifically, rods are sensitive to vision in low light conditions, and cones are sensitive to brighter conditions.
In normal sunlight, rhodopsin will be constantly bleached while the cones are active.
In a darkened room, there is not enough light to activate cone opsins, and vision is entirely dependent on rods.
Rods are so sensitive to light that a single photon can result in an action potential from a rod‚Äô s corresponding RGC.
The three types of cone opsins, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, provide us with color vision.
By comparingtheactivityofthethreedifferentcones,thebraincanextractcolorinformationfromvisualstimuli.Forexample, a bright blue light that has a wavelength of approximately 450 nm would activate the ‚Äúred‚Äù cones minimally, the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù cones marginally, and the ‚Äúblue‚Äù cones predominantly.
The relative activation of the three different cones is calculated by the brain, which perceives the color as blue.
However, cones cannot react to low-intensity light, and rods do not sense the color of light.
Therefore, our low-light vision is‚Äîin essence‚Äîin grayscale.
In other words, in a dark room, everything appears as a shade of gray.
If you think that you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what color something is and is relying on that memory.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 579 Figure 14.18 Comparison of Color Sensitivity of Photopigments Comparing the peak sensitivity and absorbance spectra of the four photopigments suggests that they are most sensitive to particular wavelengths.

Explain your answer.
Sensory Nerves Once any sensory cell transduces a stimulus into a nerve impulse, that impulse has to travel along axons to reach the CNS.
In many of the special senses, the axons leaving the sensory receptors have a topographical arrangement, meaning that the location of the sensory receptor relates to the location of the axon in the nerve.
For example, in the retina, axons from RGCsinthefoveaarelocatedatthecenteroftheopticnerve,wheretheyaresurroundedbyaxonsfromthemoreperipheral RGCs.
Spinal Nerves Generally, spinal nerves contain afferent axons from sensory receptors in the periphery, such as from the skin, mixed with efferent axons travelling to the muscles or other effector organs.
As the spinal nerve nears the spinal cord, it splits into dorsal and ventral roots.
The dorsal root contains only the axons of sensory neurons, whereas the ventral roots contain only theaxons of themotorneurons.
Some of thebrancheswillsynapse with localneurons in thedorsal root ganglion,posterior (dorsal) horn, or even the anterior (ventral) horn, at the level of the spinal cord where they enter.
Other branches will travel ashortdistanceupordownthespinetointeractwithneuronsatotherlevelsofthespinalcord.Abranchmayalsoturninto the posterior (dorsal) column of the white matter to connect with the brain.
For the sake of convenience, we will use the terms ventral and dorsal in reference to structures within the spinal cord that are part of these pathways.
This will help to580 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 underscoretherelationshipsbetweenthedifferentcomponents.Typically,spinalnervesystemsthatconnecttothebrainare contralateral , in that the right side of the body is connected to the left side of the brain and the left side of the body to the right side of the brain.
Cranial Nerves Cranial nerves convey specific sensory information from the head and neck directly to the brain.
For sensations below the neck, the right side of the body is connected to the left side of the brain and the left side of the body to the right side of the brain.Whereasspinalinformationiscontralateral,cranialnervesystemsaremostly ipsilateral ,meaningthatacranialnerve ontherightsideoftheheadisconnectedtotherightsideofthebrain.Somecranialnervescontainonlysensoryaxons,such as the olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves.
Other cranial nerves contain both sensory and motor axons, including the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves (however, the vagus nerve is not associated with the somatic nervous system).
The general senses of somatosensation for the face travel through the trigeminal system.
14.2|Central Processing By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the pathways that sensory systems follow into the central nervous system ‚Ä¢Differentiate between the two major ascending pathways in the spinal cord ‚Ä¢Describe the pathway of somatosensory input from the face and compare it to the ascending pathways in the spinal cord ‚Ä¢Explain topographical representations of sensory information in at least two systems ‚Ä¢Describe two pathways of visual processing and the functions associated with each Sensory Pathways Specific regions of the CNS coordinate different somatic processes using sensory inputs and motor outputs of peripheral nerves.
A simple case is a reflex caused by a synapse between a dorsal sensory neuron axon and a motor neuron in the ventral horn.
More complex arrangements are possible to integrate peripheral sensory information with higher processes.
The important regions of the CNS that play a role in somatic processes can be separated into the spinal cord brain stem, diencephalon, cerebral cortex, and subcortical structures.
Spinal Cord and Brain Stem A sensory pathway that carries peripheral sensations to the brain is referred to as an ascending pathway, or ascending tract.
The various sensory modalities each follow specific pathways through the CNS.
Tactile and other somatosensory stimuli activate receptors in the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints throughout the entire body.
However, the somatosensory pathways are divided into two separate systems on the basis of the location of the receptor neurons.
Somatosensory stimuli from below the neck pass along the sensory pathways of the spinal cord, whereas somatosensory stimuli from the head and neck travel through the cranial nerves‚Äîspecifically, the trigeminal system.
Thedorsal column system (sometimes referred to as the dorsal column‚Äìmedial lemniscus) and the spinothalamic tractare two major pathways that bring sensory information to the brain (Figure 14.19).
The sensory pathways in each of these systems are composed of three successive neurons.
Thedorsalcolumnsystembeginswiththeaxonofadorsalrootganglionneuronenteringthedorsalrootandjoiningthe dorsal column white matter in the spinal cord.
As axons of this pathway enter the dorsal column, they take on a positional arrangement so that axons from lower levels of the body position themselves medially, whereas axons from upper levels of the body position themselves laterally.
The dorsal column is separated into two component tracts, the fasciculus gracilis thatcontainsaxonsfromthelegsandlowerbody,andthe fasciculuscuneatus thatcontainsaxonsfromtheupperbodyand arms.
The axons in the dorsal column terminate in the nuclei of the medulla, where each synapses with the second neuron in theirrespectivepathway.The nucleusgracilis isthetargetoffibersinthefasciculusgracilis,whereasthe nucleuscuneatus is the target of fibers in the fasciculus cuneatus.
The second neuron in the system projects from one of the two nuclei and thendecussates, or crosses the midline of the medulla.
These axons then continue to ascend the brain stem as a bundle called the medial lemniscus.
These axons terminate in the thalamus, where each synapses with the third neuron in their respective pathway.
The third neuron in the system projects its axons to the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex, where somatosensory stimuli are initially processed and the conscious perception of the stimulus occurs.
The spinothalamic tract also begins with neurons in a dorsal root ganglion.
These neurons extend their axons to the dorsalhorn,wheretheysynapsewiththesecondneuronintheirrespectivepathway.Thename‚Äúspinothalamic‚Äùcomesfrom this second neuron, which has its cell body in the spinal cord gray matter and connects to the thalamus.
Axons from these second neurons then decussate within the spinal cord and ascend to the brain and enter the thalamus, where each synapses with the third neuron in its respective pathway.
The neurons in the thalamus then project their axons to the spinothalamic tract, which synapses in the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 581 These two systems are similar in that they both begin with dorsal root ganglion cells, as with most general sensory information.
The dorsal column system is primarily responsible for touch sensations and proprioception, whereas the spinothalamic tract pathway is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensations.
Another similarity is that the second neurons in both of these pathways are contralateral, because they project across the midline to the other side of the brain or spinal cord.
In the dorsal column system, this decussation takes place in the brain stem; in the spinothalamic pathway, it takes place in the spinal cord at the same spinal cord level at which the information entered.
The third neurons in the two pathways are essentially the same.
In both, the second neuron synapses in the thalamus, and the thalamic neuron projects to the somatosensory cortex.
Figure 14.19 Ascending Sensory Pathways of the Spinal Cord The dorsal column system and spinothalamic tract are the major ascending pathways that connect the periphery with the brain.
The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity.
As with the previously discussed nerve tracts, the sensory pathways of the trigeminal pathway each involve three successive neurons.
First, axons from the trigeminal ganglion enter the brain stem at the level of the pons.
These axons project to one of threelocations.The spinaltrigeminalnucleus ofthemedullareceivesinformationsimilartothatcarriedbyspinothalamic tract, such as pain and temperature sensations.
Other axons go to either the chief sensory nucleus in the pons or the mesencephalicnuclei inthemidbrain.Thesenucleireceiveinformationlikethatcarriedbythedorsalcolumnsystem,such astouch,pressure,vibration,andproprioception.Axonsfromthesecondneurondecussateandascendtothethalamusalong the trigeminothalamic tract.
In the thalamus, each axon synapses with the third neuron in its respective pathway.
Axons from the third neuron then project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebrum.
The sensory pathway for gustation travels along the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, which synapse with neurons of the solitary nucleus in the brain stem.
Axons from the solitary nucleus then project to the ventral posterior nucleusof the thalamus.
Finally, axons from the ventral posterior nucleus project to the gustatory cortex of the cerebral cortex, where taste is processed and consciously perceived.582 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The sensory pathway for audition travels along the vestibulocochlear nerve, which synapses with neurons in the cochlear nuclei of the superior medulla.
Within the brain stem, input from either ear is combined to extract location information from the auditory stimuli.
Whereas the initial auditory stimuli received at the cochlea strictly represent the frequency‚Äîor pitch‚Äîof the stimuli, the locations of sounds can be determined by comparing information arriving at both ears.
Sound localization is a feature of central processing in the auditory nuclei of the brain stem.
Sound localization is achieved by the brain calculating the interaural time difference and theinteraural intensity difference .
A sound originating from a specific location will arrive at each ear at different times, unless the sound is directly in front of the listener.
If the sound source is slightly to the left of the listener, the sound will arrive at the left ear microseconds before it arrives at the right ear (Figure 14.20).
This time difference is an example of an interaural time difference.
Also, the sound will be slightly louder in the left ear than in the right ear because some of the sound waves reaching the opposite ear are blocked by the head.
This is an example of an interaural intensity dif ference.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 583 Figure 14.20 Auditory Brain Stem Mechanisms of Sound Localization Localizing sound in the horizontal plane is achieved by processing in the medullary nuclei of the auditory system.
Connections between neurons on either side are able to compare very slight differences in sound stimuli that arrive at either ear and represent interaural time and intensity differences.
Auditory processing continues on to a nucleus in the midbrain called the inferior colliculus .
Axons from the inferior colliculus project to two locations, the thalamus and the superior colliculus.
The medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus receives the auditory information and then projects that information to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex.
The superior colliculus receives input from the visual and somatosensory systems, as well as the ears, to initiate stimulation of the muscles that turn the head and neck toward the auditory stimulus.
Balance is coordinated through the vestibular system, the nerves of which are composed of axons from the vestibular ganglion that carries information from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals.
The system contributes to controlling head and neck movements in response to vestibular signals.
An important function of the vestibular system is coordinating eye and head movements to maintain visual attention.
Most of the axons terminate in the vestibular nuclei of the medulla.584 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Some axons project from the vestibular ganglion directly to the cerebellum, with no intervening synapse in the vestibular nuclei.
The cerebellum is primarily responsible for initiating movements on the basis of equilibrium information.
Neurons in the vestibular nuclei project their axons to targets in the brain stem.
One target is the reticular formation, which influences respiratory and cardiovascular functions in relation to body movements.
A second target of the axons of neurons in the vestibular nuclei is the spinal cord, which initiates the spinal reflexes involved with posture and balance.
To assist the visual system, fibers of the vestibular nuclei project to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei to influence signals sent along the cranial nerves.
These connections constitute the pathway of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which compensates for head and body movement by stabilizing images on the retina (Figure 14.21).
Finally, the vestibularnucleiprojecttothethalamustojointheproprioceptivepathwayofthedorsalcolumnsystem,allowingconscious perception of equilibrium.
Figure 14.21 Vestibulo-ocular Reflex Connections between the vestibular system and the cranial nerves controlling eye movement keep the eyes centered on a visual stimulus, even though the head is moving.
During head movement, the eye muscles move the eyes in the opposite direction as the head movement, keeping the visual stimulus centered in the field of view.
Theconnectionsoftheopticnervearemorecomplicatedthanthoseofothercranialnerves.Insteadoftheconnections being between each eye and the brain, visual information is segregated between the left and right sides of the visual field.
In addition, some of the information from one side of the visual field projects to the opposite side of the brain.
Within each eye, the axons projecting from the medial side of the retina decussate at the optic chiasm.
For example, the axons from the medialretinaofthelefteyecrossovertotherightsideofthebrainattheopticchiasm.However,withineacheye,theaxons projectingfromthelateralsideoftheretinadonotdecussate.Forexample,theaxonsfromthelateralretinaoftherighteye project back to the right side of the brain.
Therefore the left field of view of each eye is processed on the right side of the brain, whereas the right field of view of each eye is processed on the left side of the brain ( Figure 14.22 ).CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 585 Figure 14.22 Segregation of Visual Field Information at the Optic Chiasm Contralateral visual field information from the lateral retina projects to the ipsilateral brain, whereas ipsilateral visual field information has to decussate at the optic chiasm to reach the opposite side of the brain.
A unique clinical presentation that relates to this anatomic arrangement is the loss of lateral peripheral vision, known as bilateral hemianopia.
This is different from ‚Äútunnel vision‚Äù because the superior and inferior peripheral fields are not lost.
Visual field deficits can be disturbing for a patient, but in this case, the cause is not within the visual system itself.
A growth of the pituitary gland presses against the optic chiasm and interferes with signal transmission.
However, the axons projectingtothesamesideofthebrainareunaffected.Therefore,thepatientlosestheoutermostareasoftheirfieldofvision and cannot see objects to their right and left.
Extending from the optic chiasm, the axons of the visual system are referred to as the optic tract instead of the optic nerve.
The optic tract has three major targets, two in the diencephalon and one in the midbrain.
The connection between the eyes and diencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina differentiates from thatofthediencephalonbythegrowthofthesecondaryvesicles.TheconnectionsoftheretinaintotheCNSareaholdover from this developmental association.
The majority of the connections of the optic tract are to the thalamus‚Äîspecifically, thelateral geniculate nucleus.
Axons from this nucleus then project to the visual cortex of the cerebrum, located in the occipital lobe.
Another target of the optic tract is the superior colliculus.
In addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus.
These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light.
Unlike the photoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images.
By simply responding to the absence or presence of light, these RGCs can send information about day length.
The perceived proportion of sunlight to darkness establishes the circadian rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain physiological events to occur at approximately the same time every day.
Diencephalon The diencephalon is beneath the cerebrum and includes the thalamus and hypothalamus.
In the somatic nervous system, the thalamus is an important relay for communication between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system.
The hypothalamus has both somatic and autonomic functions.
In addition, the hypothalamus communicates with the limbic system, which controls emotions and memory functions.
Sensoryinputtothethalamuscomesfrommostofthespecialsensesandascendingsomatosensorytracts.Eachsensory system is relayed through a particular nucleus in the thalamus.
The thalamus is a required transfer point for most sensory tracts that reach the cerebral cortex, where conscious sensory perception begins.
The one exception to this rule is the olfactory system.
The olfactory tract axons from the olfactory bulb project directly to the cerebral cortex, along with the limbic system and hypothalamus.586 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The thalamus is a collection of several nuclei that can be categorized into three anatomical groups.
White matter running through the thalamus defines the three major regions of the thalamus, which are an anterior nucleus, a medial nucleus, and a lateral group of nuclei.
The anterior nucleus serves as a relay between the hypothalamus and the emotion and memory-producing limbic system.
The medial nuclei serve as a relay for information from the limbic system and basal ganglia to the cerebral cortex.
This allows memory creation during learning, but also determines alertness.
The special and somatic senses connect to the lateral nuclei, where their information is relayed to the appropriate sensory cortex of the cerebrum.
Cortical Processing As described earlier, many of the sensory axons are positioned in the same way as their corresponding receptor cells in the body.
This allows identification of the position of a stimulus on the basis of which receptor cells are sending information.
The cerebral cortex also maintains this sensory topography in the particular areas of the cortex that correspond to the position of the receptor cells.
The somatosensory cortex provides an example in which, in essence, the locations of the somatosensory receptors in the body are mapped onto the somatosensory cortex.
This mapping is often depicted using a sensory homunculus (Figure 14.23 ).
The term homunculus comes from the Latin word for ‚Äúlittle man‚Äù and refers to a map of the human body that is laid across a portion of the cerebral cortex.
In the somatosensory cortex, the external genitals, feet, and lower legs are represented on the medial face of the gyrus within the longitudinal fissure.
As the gyrus curves out of the fissure and along the surface of the parietal lobe, the body map continues through the thighs, hips, trunk, shoulders, arms, and hands.
The head and face are just lateral to the fingers as the gyrus approaches the lateral sulcus.
The representation of the body in this topographical map is medial to lateral from the lower to upper body.
It is a continuation of the topographical arrangement seen in the dorsal column system, where axons from the lower body are carried in the fasciculus gracilis, whereas axons from the upper body are carried in the fasciculus cuneatus.
As the dorsal column system continues into the medial lemniscus, these relationships are maintained.
Also, the head and neck axons running from the trigeminal nuclei to the thalamus run adjacent to the upper body fibers.
The connections through the thalamus maintain topography such that the anatomic information is preserved.
Note that this correspondence does not result in a perfectly miniature scale version of the body, but rather exaggerates the more sensitive areas of the body, such as the fingers and lower face.
Less sensitive areas of the body, such as the shoulders and back, are mapped to smaller areas on the cortex.
Figure 14.23 The Sensory Homunculus A cartoon representation of the sensory homunculus arranged adjacent to the cortical region in which the processing takes place.
Likewise, the topographic relationship between the retina and the visual cortex is maintained throughout the visual pathway.
The visual field is projected onto the two retinae, as described above, with sorting at the optic chiasm.
The right peripheralvisualfieldfallsonthemedialportionoftherightretinaandthelateralportionoftheleftretina.Therightmedial retina then projects across the midline through the optic chiasm.
This results in the right visual field being processed in the leftvisualcortex.Likewise,theleftvisualfieldisprocessedintherightvisualcortex(see Figure14.22).ThoughthechiasmCHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 587 is helping to sort right and left visual information, superior and inferior visual information is maintained topographically in the visual pathway.
Light from the superior visual field falls on the inferior retina, and light from the inferior visual field falls on the superior retina.
This topography is maintained such that the superior region of the visual cortex processes the inferior visual field and vice versa.
Therefore, the visual field information is inverted and reversed as it enters the visual cortex‚Äîup is down, and left is right.
However, the cortex processes the visual information such that the final conscious perception of the visual field is correct.
The topographic relationship is evident in that information from the foveal region oftheretinaisprocessedinthecenteroftheprimaryvisualcortex.Informationfromtheperipheralregionsoftheretinaare correspondingly processed toward the edges of the visual cortex.
Similar to the exaggerations in the sensory homunculus of the somatosensory cortex, the foveal-processing area of the visual cortex is disproportionately larger than the areas processing peripheral vision.
In an experiment performed in the 1960s, subjects wore prism glasses so that the visual field was inverted before reaching the eye.
On the first day of the experiment, subjects would duck when walking up to a table, thinking it was suspended from the ceiling.
However, after a few days of acclimation, the subjects behaved as if everything were represented correctly.
Therefore, the visual cortex is somewhat flexible in adapting to the information it receives from our eyes (Figure 14.24 ).
Figure 14.24 Topographic Mapping of the Retina onto the Visual Cortex The visual field projects onto the retina through the lenses and falls on the retinae as an inverted, reversed image.
The topography of this image is maintained as the visual information travels through the visual pathway to the cortex.588 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The cortex has been described as having specific regions that are responsible for processing specific information; there is the visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, gustatory cortex, etc.
However, our experience of these senses is not divided.
Instead, we experience what can be referred to as a seamless percept.
Our perceptions of the various sensory modalities‚Äîthough distinct in their content‚Äîare integrated by the brain so that we experience the world as a continuous whole.
Inthecerebralcortex,sensoryprocessingbeginsatthe primarysensorycortex,thenproceedstoan associationarea, and finally, into a multimodal integration area .
For example, the visual pathway projects from the retinae through the thalamus to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe.
This area is primarily in the medial wall within the longitudinal fissure.
Here, visual stimuli begin to be recognized as basic shapes.
Edges of objects are recognized and built into more complex shapes.
Also, inputs from both eyes are compared to extract depth information.
Because of the overlapping field of view between the two eyes, the brain can begin to estimate the distance of stimuli based on binocular depth cues.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/l_3-D1) to learn more about how the brain perceives 3-D motion.
Similar to how retinal disparity offers 3-D moviegoers a way to extract 3-D information from the two-dimensional visual field projected onto the retina, the brain can extract information about movement in space by comparing what the two eyes see.
If movement of a visual stimulus is leftward in one eye and rightward in the opposite eye, the brain interpretsthisasmovementtoward(oraway)fromthefacealongthemidline.Ifbotheyesseeanobjectmovinginthe same direction, but at different rates, what would that mean for spatial movement?CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 589 Depth Perception, 3-D Movies, and Optical Illusions The visual field is projected onto the retinal surface, where photoreceptors transduce light energy into neural signals forthebraintointerpret.Theretinaisatwo-dimensionalsurface,soitdoesnotencodethree-dimensionalinformation.
However, we can perceive depth.
How is that accomplished?
Two ways in which we can extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal signal are based on monocular cues and binocular cues, respectively.
Monocular depth cues are those that are the result of information within the two-dimensional visual field.
One object that overlaps another object has to be in front.
Relative size differences are also a cue.
For example, if a basketball appears larger than the basket, then the basket must be further away.
On the basis of experience, we can estimate how far away the basket is.
Binocular depth cues compare information represented in the two retinae because they do not see the visual field exactly the same.
Thecentersofthetwoeyesareseparatedbyasmalldistance,whichisapproximately6to6.5cminmostpeople.
Because of this offset, visual stimuli do not fall on exactly the same spot on both retinae unless we are fixated directly onthemandtheyfallonthefoveaofeachretina.Allotherobjectsinthevisualfield,eithercloserorfartherawaythan the fixated object, will fall on different spots on the retina.
When vision is fixed on an object in space, closer objects will fall on the lateral retina of each eye, and more distant objects will fall on the medial retina of either eye ( Figure 14.25).
This is easily observed by holding a finger up in front of your face as you look at a more distant object.
You will see two images of your finger that represent the two disparate images that are falling on either retina.
These depth cues, both monocular and binocular, can be exploited to make the brain think there are three dimensionsintwo-dimensionalinformation.Thisisthebasisof3-Dmovies.Theprojectedimageonthescreenistwo dimensional, but it has disparate information embedded in it.
The 3-D glasses that are available at the theater filter the information so that only one eye sees one version of what is on the screen, and the other eye sees the other version.
If you take the glasses off, the image on the screen will have varying amounts of blur because both eyes are seeing both layers of information, and the third dimension will not be evident.
Some optical illusions can take advantage of depth cuesaswell,thoughthosearemoreoftenusingmonocularcuestofoolthebrainintoseeingdifferentpartsofthescene as being at different depths.590 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 14.25 Retinal Disparity Because of the interocular distance, which results in objects of different distances falling on different spots of the two retinae, the brain can extract depth perception from the two-dimensional information of the visual field.
There are two main regions that surround the primary cortex that are usually referred to as areas V2 and V3 (the primary visual cortex is area V1).
These surrounding areas are the visual association cortex.

Brain: Prosopagnosia The failures of sensory perception can be unusual and debilitating.
A particular sensory deficit that inhibits an important social function of humans is prosopagnosia, or face blindness.
The word comes from the Greek words prosopa,thatmeans‚Äúfaces,‚Äùandagnosia,thatmeans‚Äúnotknowing.‚ÄùSomepeoplemayfeelthattheycannotrecognize people easily by their faces.
However, a person with prosopagnosia cannot recognize the most recognizable people in their respective cultures.
They would not recognize the face of a celebrity, an important historical figure, or even a family member like their mother.
They may not even recognize their own face.
Prosopagnosia can be caused by trauma to the brain, or it can be present from birth.
The exact cause of proposagnosia and the reason that it happens to some people is unclear.
A study of the brains of people born with the deficit found that a specific region of the brain, the anterior fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe, is often underdeveloped.Thisregionofthebrainisconcernedwiththerecognitionofvisualstimulianditspossibleassociation with memories.
Though the evidence is not yet definitive, this region is likely to be where facial recognition occurs.
Though this can be a devastating condition, people who suffer from it can get by‚Äîoften by using other cues to recognize the people they see.
Often, the sound of a person‚Äôs voice, or the presence of unique cues such as distinct facial features (a mole, for example) or hair color can help the sufferer recognize a familiar person.

What other information can a person suffering from prosopagnosia use to figure out whom they are seeing?592 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 14.3|Motor Responses By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢List the components of the basic processing stream for the motor system ‚Ä¢Describe the pathway of descending motor commands from the cortex to the skeletal muscles ‚Ä¢Compare different descending pathways, both by structure and function ‚Ä¢Explain the initiation of movement from the neurological connections ‚Ä¢Describe several reflex arcs and their functional roles The defining characteristic of the somatic nervous system is that it controls skeletal muscles.
Somatic senses inform the nervous system about the external environment, but the response to that is through voluntary muscle movement.
The term ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù suggests that there is a conscious decision to make a movement.
However, some aspects of the somatic system use voluntary muscles without conscious control.
One example is the ability of our breathing to switch to unconscious control while we are focused on another task.
However, the muscles that are responsible for the basic process of breathing are also utilized for speech, which is entirely voluntary.
Cortical Responses Let‚ÄôsstartwithsensorystimulithathavebeenregisteredthroughreceptorcellsandtheinformationrelayedtotheCNSalong ascendingpathways.Inthecerebralcortex,theinitialprocessingofsensoryperceptionprogressestoassociativeprocessing and then integration in multimodal areas of cortex.
These levels of processing can lead to the incorporation of sensory perceptions into memory, but more importantly, they lead to a response.
The completion of cortical processing through the primary, associative, and integrative sensory areas initiates a similar progression of motor processing, usually in different cortical areas.
Whereas the sensory cortical areas are located in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, motor functions are largely controlled by the frontal lobe.
The most anterior regions of the frontal lobe‚Äîthe prefrontal areas‚Äîare important forexecutive functions , which are those cognitive functions that lead to goal-directed behaviors.
These higher cognitive processes include working memory, which has been called a ‚Äúmental scratch pad,‚Äù that can help organize and represent information that is not in the immediate environment.
The prefrontal lobe is responsible for aspects of attention, such as inhibiting distracting thoughts and actions so that a person can focus on a goal and direct behavior toward achieving that goal.
The functions of the prefrontal cortex are integral to the personality of an individual, because it is largely responsible for what a person intends to do and how they accomplish those plans.
A famous case of damage to the prefrontal cortex is that of Phineas Gage, dating back to 1848.
He was a railroad worker who had a metal spike impale his prefrontal cortex(Figure14.27).Hesurvivedtheaccident,butaccordingtosecond-handaccounts,hispersonalitychangeddrastically.
Friends described him as no longer acting like himself.
Whereas he was a hardworking, amiable man before the accident, he turned into an irritable, temperamental, and lazy man after the accident.
Many of the accounts of his change may have been inflated in the retelling, and some behavior was likely attributable to alcohol used as a pain medication.
However, the accounts suggest that some aspects of his personality did change.
Also, there is new evidence that though his life changed dramatically, he was able to become a functioning stagecoach driver, suggesting that the brain has the ability to recover even from major trauma such as this.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 593 (a) (b) Figure 14.27 Phineas Gage The victim of an accident while working on a railroad in 1848, Phineas Gage had a large iron rod impaled through the prefrontal cortex of his frontal lobe.
After the accident, his personality appeared to change, but he eventually learned to cope with the trauma and lived as a coach driver even after such a traumatic event.
(credit b: John M. Harlow, MD) Secondary Motor Cortices In generating motor responses, the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex will need to initiate actual movements.
One waytodefinetheprefrontalareaisanyregionofthefrontallobethatdoesnotelicitmovementwhenelectricallystimulated.
These are primarily in the anterior part of the frontal lobe.
The regions of the frontal lobe that remain are the regions of the cortex that produce movement.
The prefrontal areas project into the secondary motor cortices, which include the premotor cortexand thesupplemental motor area.
Two important regions that assist in planning and coordinating movements are located adjacent to the primary motor cortex.Thepremotorcortexismorelateral,whereasthesupplementalmotorareaismoremedialandsuperior.Thepremotor area aids in controlling movements of the core muscles to maintain posture during movement, whereas the supplemental motor area is hypothesized to be responsible for planning and coordinating movement.
The supplemental motor area also manages sequential movements that are based on prior experience (that is, learned movements).
Neurons in these areas are most active leading up to the initiation of movement.
For example, these areas might prepare the body for the movements necessary to drive a car in anticipation of a traffic light changing.
Adjacent to these two regions are two specialized motor planning centers.
The frontal eye fields are responsible for moving the eyes in response to visual stimuli.
There are direct connections between the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus.
Also, anterior to the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex is Broca‚Äôs area.
This area is responsible for controllingmovementsofthestructuresofspeechproduction.TheareaisnamedafteraFrenchsurgeonandanatomistwho studied patients who could not produce speech.
They did not have impairments to understanding speech, only to producing speech sounds, suggesting a damaged or underdeveloped Broca‚Äôs area.594 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Primary Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe.
A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum.
Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe responses to the stimulation.
This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement.
We now knowthattheprimarymotorcortexreceivesinputfromseveralareasthataidinplanningmovement,anditsprincipleoutput stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction.
The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23).
The neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure.
The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus.
Also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation.
The greatest amount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face.
The ‚Äúpower muscles‚Äù that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex.
Descending Pathways The motor output from the cortex descends into the brain stem and to the spinal cord to control the musculature through motorneurons.Neuronslocatedintheprimarymotorcortex,named Betzcells,arelargecorticalneuronsthatsynapsewith lower motor neurons in the spinal cord or the brain stem.
The two descending pathways travelled by the axons of Betz cells are the corticospinal tract and thecorticobulbar tract.
Both tracts are named for their origin in the cortex and their targets‚Äîeither the spinal cord or the brain stem (the term ‚Äúbulbar‚Äù refers to the brain stem as the bulb, or enlargement, at the top of the spinal cord).
These two descending pathways are responsible for the conscious or voluntary movements of skeletal muscles.
Any motor command from the primary motor cortex is sent down the axons of the Betz cells to activate upper motor neurons in either the cranial motor nuclei or in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.
The axons of the corticobulbar tract are ipsilateral, meaning they project from the cortex to the motor nucleus on the same side of the nervous system.
Conversely, the axons of the corticospinal tract are largely contralateral, meaning that they cross the midline of the brain stem or spinal cord and synapseontheoppositesideofthebody.Therefore,therightmotorcortexofthecerebrumcontrolsmusclesontheleftside of the body, and vice versa.
Thecorticospinaltractdescendsfromthecortexthroughthedeepwhitematterofthecerebrum.Itthenpassesbetween the caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal nuclei as a bundle called the internal capsule.
The tract then passes through the midbrain as the cerebral peduncles, after which it burrows through the pons.
Upon entering the medulla, the tracts make up the large white matter tract referred to as the pyramids (Figure 14.28).
The defining landmark of the medullary- spinal border is the pyramidal decussation , which is where most of the fibers in the corticospinal tract cross over to the opposite side of the brain.
At this point, the tract separates into two parts, which have control over different domains of the musculature.CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 595 Figure 14.28 Corticospinal Tract The major descending tract that controls skeletal muscle movements is the corticospinal tract.
It is composed of two neurons, the upper motor neuron and the lower motor neuron.
The upper motor neuron has its cell body in the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe and synapses on the lower motor neuron, which is in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and projects to the skeletal muscle in the periphery .
Appendicular Control Thelateral corticospinal tract is composed of the fibers that cross the midline at the pyramidal decussation (see Figure 14.28).
The axons cross over from the anterior position of the pyramids in the medulla to the lateral column of the spinal cord.
These axons are responsible for controlling appendicular muscles.
This influence over the appendicular muscles means that the lateral corticospinal tract is responsible for moving the muscles of the arms and legs.
The ventral horn in both the lower cervical spinal cord and the lumbar spinal cord both have wider ventral horns, representing the greater number of muscles controlled by these motor neurons.
The cervical enlargement is particularly large because there is greater control over the fine musculature of the upper limbs, particularly596 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 of the fingers.
The lumbar enlargement is not as significant in appearance because there is less fine motor control of the lower limbs.
Axial Control Theanterior corticospinal tract is responsible for controlling the muscles of the body trunk (see Figure 14.28).
These axons do not decussate in the medulla.
Instead, they remain in an anterior position as they descend the brain stem and enter the spinal cord.
These axons then travel to the spinal cord level at which they synapse with a lower motor neuron.
Upon reaching the appropriate level, the axons decussate, entering the ventral horn on the opposite side of the spinal cord from which they entered.
In the ventral horn, these axons synapse with their corresponding lower motor neurons.
The lower motor neurons are located in the medial regions of the ventral horn, because they control the axial muscles of the trunk.
Because movements of the body trunk involve both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract is not entirely contralateral.Somecollateralbranchesofthetractwillprojectintotheipsilateralventralhorntocontrolsynergisticmuscles on that side of the body, or to inhibit antagonistic muscles through interneurons within the ventral horn.
Through the influence of both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract can coordinate postural muscles in broad movements of the body.
These coordinating axons in the anterior corticospinal tract are often considered bilateral, as they are both ipsilateral and contralateral.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/motorpathway) to learn more about the descending motor pathway for the somatic nervous system.
The autonomic connections are mentioned, which are covered in another chapter.
From this brief video, only some of the descending motor pathway of the somatic nervous system is described.
Which division of the pathway is described and which division is left out?
Extrapyramidal Controls Other descending connections between the brain and the spinal cord are called the extrapyramidal system .
The name comes from the fact that this system is outside the corticospinal pathway, which includes the pyramids in the medulla.
A few pathways originating from the brain stem contribute to this system.
Thetectospinal tract projects from the midbrain to the spinal cord and is important for postural movements that are driven by the superior colliculus.
The name of the tract comes from an alternate name for the superior colliculus, which is the tectum.
The reticulospinal tract connects the reticular system, a diffuse region of gray matter in the brain stem, with thespinalcord.Thistractinfluencestrunkandproximallimbmusclesrelatedtopostureandlocomotion.Thereticulospinal tractalsocontributestomuscletoneandinfluencesautonomicfunctions.The vestibulospinaltract connectsthebrainstem nuclei of the vestibular system with the spinal cord.

Thepathwaysoftheextrapyramidalsystemareinfluencedbysubcorticalstructures.Forexample,connectionsbetween the secondary motor cortices and the extrapyramidal system modulate spine and cranium movements.
The basal nuclei, which are important for regulating movement initiated by the CNS, influence the extrapyramidal system as well as its thalamic feedback to the motor cortex.
The conscious movement of our muscles is more complicated than simply sending a single command from the precentral gyrus down to the proper motor neurons.
During the movement of any body part, our muscles relay information backtothebrain,andthebrainisconstantlysending‚Äúrevised‚Äùinstructionsbacktothemuscles.Thecerebellumisimportant in contributing to the motor system because it compares cerebral motor commands with proprioceptive feedback.

The name of this tract comes from the word for red that is seen in the English word ‚Äúruby .‚ÄùCHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 597 A good example of how the cerebellum corrects cerebral motor commands can be illustrated by walking in water.
An originalmotorcommandfromthecerebrumtowalkwillresultinahighlycoordinatedsetoflearnedmovements.However, in water, the body cannot actually perform a typical walking movement as instructed.
The cerebellum can alter the motor command, stimulating the leg muscles to take larger steps to overcome the water resistance.
The cerebellum can make the necessary changes through the rubrospinal tract.
Modulating the basic command to walk also relies on spinal reflexes, but the cerebellum is responsible for calculating the appropriate response.
When the cerebellum does not work properly, coordinationandbalanceareseverelyaffected.Themostdramaticexampleofthisisduringtheoverconsumptionofalcohol.
Alcohol inhibits the ability of the cerebellum to interpret proprioceptive feedback, making it more difficult to coordinate body movements, such as walking a straight line, or guide the movement of the hand to touch the tip of the nose.

What regions of the nervous system are likely to be the focus of haloperidol side ef fects?
Ventral Horn Output The somatic nervous system provides output strictly to skeletal muscles.
The lower motor neurons, which are responsible for the contraction of these muscles, are found in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.
These large, multipolar neurons have a corona of dendrites surrounding the cell body and an axon that extends out of the ventral horn.
This axon travels through the ventral nerve root to join the emerging spinal nerve.
The axon is relatively long because it needs to reach muscles in the periphery of the body.
The diameters of cell bodies may be on the order of hundreds of micrometers to support the long axon; some axons are a meter in length, such as the lumbar motor neurons that innervate muscles in the first digits of the feet.
The axons will also branch to innervate multiple muscle fibers.
Together, the motor neuron and all the muscle fibers that it controls make up a motor unit.
Motor units vary in size.
Some may contain up to 1000 muscle fibers, such as in the quadriceps, or they may only have 10 fibers, such as in an extraocular muscle.
The number of muscle fibers that are part of a motor unit corresponds to the precision of control of that muscle.
Also, muscles that have finer motor control have more motor units connecting to them, and this requires a larger topographical field in the primary motor cortex.
Motor neuron axons connect to muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.
This is a specialized synaptic structure at which multiple axon terminals synapse with the muscle fiber sarcolemma.
The synaptic end bulbs of the motor neurons secrete acetylcholine, which binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.
The binding of acetylcholine opens ligand-gated ion channels, increasing the movement of cations across the sarcolemma.
This depolarizes the sarcolemma, initiating muscle contraction.
Whereas other synapses result in graded potentials that must reach a threshold in the postsynaptic target, activity at the neuromuscular junction reliably leads to muscle fiber contraction with every nerve impulse received from a motor neuron.
However, the strength of contraction and the number of fibers that contract can be affected by the frequency of the motor neuron impulses.
Reflexes This chapter began by introducing reflexes as an example of the basic elements of the somatic nervous system.
Simple somatic reflexes do not include the higher centers discussed for conscious or voluntary aspects of movement.
Reflexes can be spinal or cranial, depending on the nerves and central components that are involved.
The example described at the beginning of the chapter involved heat and pain sensations from a hot stove causing withdrawal of the arm through a connection in the spinal cord that leads to contraction of the biceps brachii.
The description of this withdrawal reflex was simplified, for the sake of the introduction, to emphasize the parts of the somatic nervous system.
But to consider reflexes fully, more attention needs to be given to this example.
As you withdraw your hand from the stove, you do not want to slow that reflex down.
As the biceps brachii contracts, the antagonistic triceps brachii needs to relax.
Because the neuromuscular junction is strictly excitatory, the biceps will598 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 contract when the motor nerve is active.
Skeletal muscles do not actively relax.
Instead the motor neuron needs to ‚Äúquiet down,‚Äù or be inhibited.
In the hot-stove withdrawal reflex, this occurs through an interneuron in the spinal cord.
The interneuron‚Äôs cell body is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
The interneuron receives a synapse from the axon of the sensory neuron that detects that the hand is being burned.
In response to this stimulation from the sensory neuron, the interneuron then inhibits the motor neuron that controls the triceps brachii.
This is done by releasing a neurotransmitter or other signal that hyperpolarizes the motor neuron connected to the triceps brachii, making it less likely to initiate an action potential.
With this motor neuron being inhibited, the triceps brachii relaxes.
Without the antagonistic contraction, withdrawal from the hot stove is faster and keeps further tissue damage from occurring.
Another example of a withdrawal reflex occurs when you step on a painful stimulus, like a tack or a sharp rock.
The nociceptors that are activated by the painful stimulus activate the motor neurons responsible for contraction of the tibialis anterior muscle.
This causes dorsiflexion of the foot.
An inhibitory interneuron, activated by a collateral branch of the nociceptor fiber, will inhibit the motor neurons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to cancel plantar flexion.
An importantdifferenceinthisreflexisthatplantarflexionismostlikelyinprogressasthefootispressingdownontothetack.
Contractionofthetibialisanteriorisnotthemostimportantaspectofthereflex,ascontinuationofplantarflexionwillresult in further damage from stepping onto the tack.
Another type of reflex is a stretch reflex.
In this reflex, when a skeletal muscle is stretched, a muscle spindle receptor is activated.
The axon from this receptor structure will cause direct contraction of the muscle.
A collateral of the muscle spindlefiberwillalsoinhibitthemotorneuronoftheantagonistmuscles.Thereflexhelpstomaintainmusclesataconstant length.
A common example of this reflex is the knee jerk that is elicited by a rubber hammer struck against the patellar ligament in a physical exam.
A specialized reflex to protect the surface of the eye is the corneal reflex , or the eye blink reflex.
When the cornea is stimulated by a tactile stimulus, or even by bright light in a related reflex, blinking is initiated.
The sensory component travels through the trigeminal nerve, which carries somatosensory information from the face, or through the optic nerve, if the stimulus is bright light.
The motor response travels through the facial nerve and innervates the orbicularis oculi on the same side.
This reflex is commonly tested during a physical exam using an air puff or a gentle touch of a cotton-tipped applicator.

(balance), and vision.
With the exception of somatosensation, this list represents the special senses, orthosesystemsofthebodythatareassociatedwithspecificorganssuchasthetongueoreye.Somatosensationbelongsto the general senses, which are those sensory structures that are distributed throughout the body and in the walls of various organs.
The special senses are all primarily part of the somatic nervous system in that they are consciously perceived throughcerebralprocesses,thoughsomespecialsensescontributetoautonomicfunction.Thegeneralsensescanbedivided into somatosensation, which is commonly considered touch, but includes tactile, pressure, vibration, temperature, and pain perception.Thegeneralsensesalsoincludethevisceralsenses,whichareseparatefromthesomaticnervoussystemfunction in that they do not normally rise to the level of conscious perception.
The cells that transduce sensory stimuli into the electrochemical signals of the nervous system are classified on the basis of structural or functional aspects of the cells.
The structural classifications are either based on the anatomy of the cell that is interacting with the stimulus (free nerve endings, encapsulated endings, or specialized receptor cell), or where the cell is located relative to the stimulus (interoceptor, exteroceptor, proprioceptor).
Thirdly, the functional classification is based on how the cell transduces the stimulus into a neural signal.
Chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli and are the basis for olfaction and gustation.
Related to chemoreceptors are osmoreceptors and nociceptors for fluid balance and pain reception, respectively.
Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli and are the basis for most aspects of somatosensation, as well as being the basis of audition and equilibrium in the inner ear.
Thermoreceptors are sensitive to temperature changes, and photoreceptors are sensitive to light ener gy.
The nerves that convey sensory information from the periphery to the CNS are either spinal nerves, connected to the spinalcord,orcranialnerves,connectedtothebrain.Spinalnerveshavemixedpopulationsoffibers;somearemotorfibers and some are sensory.
The sensory fibers connect to the spinal cord through the dorsal root, which is attached to the dorsal rootganglion.Sensoryinformationfromthebodythatisconveyedthroughspinalnerveswillprojecttotheoppositesideof thebraintobeprocessedbythecerebralcortex.Thecranialnervescanbestrictlysensoryfibers,suchastheolfactory,optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves, or mixed sensory and motor nerves, such as the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagusnerves.Thecranialnervesareconnectedtothesamesideofthebrainfromwhichthesensoryinformationoriginates.
14.2 Central Processing Sensory input to the brain enters through pathways that travel through either the spinal cord (for somatosensory input from the body) or the brain stem (for everything else, except the visual and olfactory systems) to reach the diencephalon.
In the diencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus.
This is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes.
The two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract.
The major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate.
The dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla.
The spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters.
The trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways.
The auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted fromthebasicfrequencystimuliprocessedbythecochlea.Soundlocalizationismadepossiblethroughtheactivityofthese606 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 brainstemstructures.Thevestibularsystementersthebrainstemandinfluencesactivityinthecerebellum,spinalcord,and cerebral cortex.
The visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other side of the brain.
Within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams, oneventralandonedorsal.Theventralvisualstreamconnectstostructuresinthetemporallobethatareimportantforlong- term memory formation.
The dorsal visual stream interacts with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and together they can influence the activity in the frontal lobe to generate movements of the body in relation to visual information.
14.3 Motor Responses The motor components of the somatic nervous system begin with the frontal lobe of the brain, where the prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher functions such as working memory.
The integrative and associate functions of the prefrontal lobe feed into the secondary motor areas, which help plan movements.
The premotor cortex and supplemental motor area then feed into the primary motor cortex that initiates movements.
Large Betz cells project through the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts to synapse on lower motor neurons in the brain stem and ventral horn of the spinal cord, respectively.
These connections are responsible for generating movements of skeletal muscles.
The extrapyramidal system includes projections from the brain stem and higher centers that influence movement, mostly to maintain balance and posture, as well as to maintain muscle tone.
The superior colliculus and red nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in the medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the brain stem each have tracts projecting to the spinal cord in this system.
Descending input from the secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and cerebellum connect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem.
All of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord to synapse with motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.Theselowermotorneuronsarethecellsthatconnecttoskeletalmuscleandcausecontractions.Theseneuronsproject through the spinal nerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular junctions.
One motor neuron connects to multiple muscle fibers within a target muscle.
The number of fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron varies on the basis of the precision necessary for that muscle and the amount of force necessary for that motor unit.
The quadriceps, for example,havemanyfiberscontrolledbysinglemotorneuronsforpowerfulcontractionsthatdonotneedtobeprecise.The extraocularmuscleshaveonlyasmallnumberoffiberscontrolledbyeachmotorneuronbecausemovingtheeyesdoesnot require much force, but needs to be very precise.
Reflexes are the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system.
A withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus only requires the sensory fiber that enters the spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to a muscle.
Antagonist and postural muscles can be coordinated with the withdrawal, making the connections more complex.
The simple, single neuronal connection is the basis of somatic reflexes.
The corneal reflex is contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle to blink the eyelid when something touches the surface of the eye.
Stretch reflexes maintain a constant length of muscles by causing a contraction of a muscle to compensate for a stretch that can be sensed by a specialized receptor called a muscle spindle.
INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS 1.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ DanielleReed) to learn about Dr. Danielle Reed of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, PA, who became interested in science at an early age because of her sensory experiences.
She recognized that her sense of taste was unique compared with other people she knew.
Now,shestudiesthegeneticdifferencesbetweenpeopleand their sensitivities to taste stimuli.
In the video, there is a brief image of a person sticking out their tongue, which has been covered with a colored dye.
This is how Dr. Reed is able to visualize and count papillae on the surface of the tongue.
People fall into two large groups known as ‚Äútasters‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-tasters‚Äù on the basis of the density of papillae on their tongue, which also indicates the number of taste buds.Non-tasterscantastefood,buttheyarenotassensitive to certain tastes, such as bitterness.
Dr. Reed discovered that she is a non-taster, which explains why she perceived bitterness differently than other people she knew.
Are you very sensitive to tastes?
Can you see any similarities among the members of your family?

Explain your answer.
6.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/l_3-D1) to learn more about how the brain perceives 3-D motion.
Similar to how retinal disparity offers 3-D moviegoers a way to extract 3-D information from the two-dimensional visual field projected onto the retina, the brain can extract information about movement in space by comparing what the two eyes see.
If movement of a visual stimulus is leftward in one eye and rightward in the opposite eye, the brain interpretsthis as movementtoward (or away) from the face along the midline.
If both eyes see an object moving in the same direction, but at different rates, what would that mean for spatial movement?

11.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ newreflex) tolearnmoreaboutnewbornreflexes.Newborns have a set of reflexes that are expected to have been crucial to survival before the modern age.
These reflexes disappear as the baby grows, as some of them may be unnecessary as they age.
The video demonstrates a reflex called the Babinski reflex, in which the foot flexes dorsally and the toes splay out when the sole of the foot is lightly scratched.
This is normal for newborns, but it is a sign of reduced myelination of the spinal tract in adults.
Why would this reflex be a problem for an adult?

Though this is not a common threat that humans deal with in the modern world, it represents the type of environment in which the human species thrived and adapted.
The spread of humans around the world to the present state of the modern age occurred much more quickly than any species would adapt to environmental pressures such as predators.
However, the reactions modern humans have in the modern world are based on these prehistoric situations.
If your boss is walking down the hallway on Friday afternoon looking forCHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 611 ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù to come in on the weekend, your response is the same as the prehistoric human seeing the lioness running across the savannah: fight or flight.
Most likely, your response to your boss‚Äînot to mention the lioness‚Äîwould be flight.
The autonomic system is responsible for the physiological response to make that possible, and hopefully successful.
Adrenaline starts to flood your circulatory system.
Your heart rate increases.
Sweat glands become active.

Thisresponse should sound abitfamiliar.
Theautonomicnervous systemis tiedintoemotionalresponses as well,and the fight-or-flight response probably sounds like a panic attack.
In the modern world, these sorts of reactions are associated with anxiety as much as with response to a threat.
It is engrained in the nervous system to respond like this.
In fact, the adaptations of the autonomic nervous system probably predate the human species and are likely to be common to all mammals, and perhaps shared by many animals.
That lioness might herself be threatened in some other situation.
However, the autonomic nervous system is not just about responding to threats.
Besides the fight-or-flight response, there are the responses referred to as ‚Äúrest and digest.‚Äù If that lioness is successful in her hunting, then she is going to rest from the exertion.
Her heart rate will slow.
Breathing will return to normal.
The digestive system has a big job to do.
Much of the function of the autonomic system is based on the connections within an autonomic, or visceral, reflex.
15.1|Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Name the components that generate the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses of the autonomic nervous system ‚Ä¢Explain the differences in output connections within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system ‚Ä¢Describe the signaling molecules and receptor proteins involved in communication within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system The nervous system can be divided into two functional parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.
The major differences between the two systems are evident in the responses that each produces.
The somatic nervoussystemcausescontractionofskeletalmuscles.Theautonomicnervoussystemcontrolscardiacandsmoothmuscle, as well as glandular tissue.
The somatic nervous system is associated with voluntary responses (though many can happen without conscious awareness, like breathing), and the autonomic nervous system is associated with involuntary responses, such as those related to homeostasis.
The autonomic nervous system regulates many of the internal organs through a balance of two aspects, or divisions.
In addition to the endocrine system, the autonomic nervous system is instrumental in homeostatic mechanisms in the body.
The two divisions of the autonomic nervous system are the sympathetic division and theparasympathetic division.
The sympatheticsystemisassociatedwiththe fight-or-flightresponse,andparasympatheticactivityisreferredtobytheepithet ofrestanddigest .Homeostasisisthebalancebetweenthetwosystems.Ateachtargeteffector,dualinnervationdetermines activity.
For example, the heart receives connections from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.
One causes heart rate to increase, whereas the other causes heart rate to decrease.

To coordinate all these responses, the connections in the sympathetic system diverge from a limited region of the central nervous system (CNS) to a wide array ofgangliathatprojecttothemanyeffectororganssimultaneously.Thecomplexsetofstructuresthatcomposetheoutputof the sympathetic system make it possible for these disparate effectors to come together in a coordinated, systemic change.
The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system influences the various organ systems of the body through connections emerging from the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord.
It is referred to as the thoracolumbar system to reflectthisanatomicalbasis.A centralneuron inthelateralhornofanyofthesespinalregionsprojectstogangliaadjacent to the vertebral column through the ventral spinal roots.
The majority of ganglia of the sympathetic system belong to a network of sympathetic chain ganglia that runs alongside the vertebral column.
The ganglia appear as a series of clusters of neurons linked by axonal bridges.
There are typically 23 ganglia in the chain on either side of the spinal column.
Three correspond to the cervical region, 12 are in the thoracic region, four are in the lumbar region, and four correspond to the sacralregion.Thecervicalandsacrallevelsarenotconnectedtothespinalcorddirectlythroughthespinalroots,butthrough ascending or descending connections through the bridges within the chain.
A diagram that shows the connections of the sympathetic system is somewhat like a circuit diagram that shows the electrical connections between different receptacles and devices.
In Figure 15.2, the ‚Äúcircuits‚Äù of the sympathetic system are intentionally simplified.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 613 Figure 15.2 Connections of Sympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System Neurons from the lateral horn of the spinal cord (preganglionic neurons) project to the chain ganglia on either side of the vertebral column or to collateral (prevertebral) ganglia that are anterior to the vertebral column in the abdominal cavity.
Axons from these ganglionic neurons (postganglionic fibers) then project to target ef fectors throughout the body.
To continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of ‚Äújunctions‚Äù that operate within the sympathetic system (Figure 15.3).
The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated).
An example of this type is spinal nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea.
The fibers of this branch are called white ramicommunicantes (singular=ramuscommunicans);theyaremyelinatedandthereforereferredtoaswhite(see Figure 15.3a).
The axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic614 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 neuron(with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line).
This neuron then projects to a target effector‚Äîin this case, the trachea‚Äîvia gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons.
Insomecases,thetargeteffectorsarelocatedsuperiororinferiortothespinalsegmentatwhichthepreganglionicfiber emerges.
With respect to the ‚Äúwiring‚Äù involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron.
An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the eye.
The spinal nervetracksupthroughthechainuntilitreachesthe superiorcervicalganglion,whereitsynapseswiththepostganglionic neuron (see Figure 15.3b).
The cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain.
Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia.
Additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve orlesser splanchnic nerve.
For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure 15.3 c).
Collateral ganglia , also called prevertebral ganglia , are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs fromsplanchnicnervesaswellascentralsympatheticneurons.Theyareassociatedwithcontrollingorgansintheabdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system.
The three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (seeFigure 15.2).
The word celiac is derived from the Latin word ‚Äúcoelom,‚Äù which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the word mesenteric refers to the digestive system.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 615 Figure 15.3 Sympathetic Connections and Chain Ganglia The axon from a central sympathetic neuron in the spinal cord can project to the periphery in a number of different ways.
(a) The fiber can project out to the ganglion at the same level and synapse on a ganglionic neuron.
(b) A branch can project to more superior or inferior ganglion in the chain.
(c) A branch can project through the white ramus communicans, but not terminate on a ganglionic neuron in the chain.
Instead, it projects through one of the splanchnic nerves to a collateral ganglion or the adrenal medulla (not pictured).
An axon from the central neuron that projects to a sympathetic ganglion is referred to as a preganglionic fiber or neuron, and represents the output from the CNS to the ganglion.
Because the sympathetic ganglia are adjacent to the vertebral column, preganglionic sympathetic fibers are relatively short, and they are myelinated.
A postganglionic fiber‚Äîthe axon from a ganglionic neuron that projects to the target effector‚Äîrepresents the output of a ganglion that directly influences the organ.
Compared with the preganglionic fibers, postganglionic sympathetic fibers are long because of the relatively greater distance from the ganglion to the target effector.
These fibers are unmyelinated.
(Note that the term ‚Äúpostganglionic neuron‚Äù may be used to describe the projection from a ganglion to the target.
The problem with that usage is that the cell body is in the ganglion, and only the fiber is postganglionic.
Typically, the term neuron applies to the entire cell.)
One type of preganglionic sympathetic fiber does not terminate in a ganglion.
These are the axons from central sympathetic neurons that project to the adrenal medulla, the interior portion of the adrenal gland.
These axons are still referred to as preganglionic fibers, but the target is not a ganglion.
The adrenal medulla releases signaling molecules into the bloodstream, rather than using axons to communicate with target structures.
The cells in the adrenal medulla that are616 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 contactedbythepreganglionicfibersarecalled chromaffincells .Thesecellsareneurosecretorycellsthatdevelopfromthe neural crest along with the sympathetic ganglia, reinforcing the idea that the gland is, functionally , a sympathetic ganglion.
The projections of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system diverge widely, resulting in a broad influenceofthesystemthroughoutthebody.Asaresponsetoathreat,thesympatheticsystemwouldincreaseheartrateand breathing rate and cause blood flow to the skeletal muscle to increase and blood flow to the digestive system to decrease.
Sweat gland secretion should also increase as part of an integrated response.
All of those physiological changes are going to be required to occur together to run away from the hunting lioness, or the modern equivalent.
This divergence is seen in the branching patterns of preganglionic sympathetic neurons‚Äîa single preganglionic sympathetic neuron may have 10‚Äì20 targets.Anaxonthatleavesacentralneuronofthelateralhorninthethoracolumbarspinalcordwillpassthroughthewhite ramus communicans and enter the sympathetic chain, where it will branch toward a variety of targets.
At the level of the spinal cord at which the preganglionic sympathetic fiber exits the spinal cord, a branch will synapse on a neuron in the adjacent chain ganglion.
Some branches will extend up or down to a different level of the chain ganglia.
Other branches will pass through the chain ganglia and project through one of the splanchnic nerves to a collateral ganglion.
Finally, some branches may project through the splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla.
All of these branches mean that one preganglionicneuroncaninfluencedifferentregionsofthesympatheticsystemverybroadly,byactingonwidelydistributed organs.
Parasympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is named because its central neurons are located on either side of the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord (para- = ‚Äúbeside‚Äù or ‚Äúnear‚Äù).
The parasympathetic system can also be referred to as the craniosacral system (or outflow) because the preganglionic neurons are located in nuclei of the brain stem and the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord.
The connections, or ‚Äúcircuits,‚Äù of the parasympathetic division are similar to the general layout of the sympathetic division with a few specific differences (Figure 15.4).
The preganglionic fibers from the cranial region travel in cranial nerves, whereas preganglionic fibers from the sacral region travel in spinal nerves.
The targets of these fibers are terminal ganglia, which are located near‚Äîor even within‚Äîthe target effector.
These ganglia are often referred to as intramural gangliawhentheyarefoundwithinthewallsofthetargetorgan.Thepostganglionicfiberprojectsfromtheterminalganglia a short distance to the target effector, or to the specific target tissue within the organ.
Comparing the relative lengths of axons in the parasympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long and the postganglionic fibers are short because the ganglia are close to‚Äîand sometimes within‚Äîthe target effectors.
The cranial component of the parasympathetic system is based in particular nuclei of the brain stem.
In the midbrain, theEddinger‚ÄìWestphal nucleus is part of the oculomotor complex, and axons from those neurons travel with the fibers in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) that innervate the extraocular muscles.
The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers within cranial nerve III terminate in the ciliary ganglion, which is located in the posterior orbit.
The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers then project to the smooth muscle of the iris to control pupillary size.
In the upper medulla, the salivatory nuclei contain neurons with axons that project through the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves to ganglia that control salivary glands.
Tear production is influenced by parasympathetic fibers in the facial nerve, which activate a ganglion, and ultimately the lacrimal (tear) gland.
Neurons in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and thenucleus ambiguus project through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to the terminal ganglia of the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers primarily influence the heart, bronchi, and esophagus in the thoracic cavity and the stomach, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and small intestine of the abdominal cavity.
The postganglionic fibers from the ganglia activated by the vagus nerve are often incorporated into the structure of the organ, such as the mesenteric plexus of the digestive tract organs and the intramural ganglia.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 617 Figure 15.4 Connections of Parasympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System Neurons from brain- stem nuclei, or from the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord, project to terminal ganglia near or within the various organs of the body.
Axons from these ganglionic neurons then project the short distance to those target effectors.
Chemical Signaling in the Autonomic Nervous System Where an autonomic neuron connects with a target, there is a synapse.
The electrical signal of the action potential causes the release of a signaling molecule, which will bind to receptor proteins on the target cell.
Synapses of the autonomic618 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 system are classified as either cholinergic , meaning that acetylcholine (ACh) is released, or adrenergic , meaning that norepinephrine is released.
The terms cholinergic and adrenergic refer not only to the signaling molecule that is released but also to the class of receptors that each binds.
The cholinergic system includes two classes of receptor: the nicotinic receptor and themuscarinic receptor .
Both receptor types bind to ACh and cause changes in the target cell.
The nicotinic receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel and the muscarinic receptor is a G protein‚Äìcoupled receptor .
The receptors are named for, and differentiated by, other moleculesthatbindtothem.Whereasnicotinewillbindtothenicotinicreceptor,andmuscarinewillbindtothemuscarinic receptor, there is no cross-reactivity between the receptors.
The situation is similar to locks and keys.
Imagine two locks‚Äîone for a classroom and the other for an office‚Äîthat are opened by two separate keys.
The classroom key will not open the office door and the office key will not open the classroom door.
This is similar to the specificity of nicotine and muscarine for their receptors.
However, a master key can open multiple locks, such as a master key for the Biology Departmentthatopensboththeclassroomandtheofficedoors.ThisissimilartoAChthatbindstobothtypesofreceptors.
The molecules that define these receptors are not crucial‚Äîthey are simply tools for researchers to use in the laboratory.
These molecules are exogenous, meaning that they are made outside of the human body, so a researcher can use them without any confounding endogenous results (results caused by the molecules produced in the body).
The adrenergic system also has two types of receptors, named the alpha (Œ±)-adrenergic receptor andbeta (Œ≤)- adrenergicreceptor .Unlikecholinergicreceptors,thesereceptortypesarenotclassifiedbywhichdrugscanbindtothem.
All of them are G protein‚Äìcoupled receptors.
There are three types of Œ±-adrenergic receptors, termed Œ± 1, Œ±2, and Œ±3, and there are two types of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors, termed Œ≤ 1and Œ≤2.
An additional aspect of the adrenergic system is that there isasecondsignalingmoleculecalled epinephrine.Thechemicaldifferencebetweennorepinephrineandepinephrineisthe addition of a methyl group (CH 3) in epinephrine.
The prefix ‚Äúnor-‚Äù actually refers to this chemical difference, in which a methyl group is missing.
The term adrenergic should remind you of the word adrenaline, which is associated with the fight-or-flight response described at the beginning of the chapter.
Adrenaline and epinephrine are two names for the same molecule.
The adrenal gland (in Latin, ad- = ‚Äúon top of‚Äù; renal = ‚Äúkidney‚Äù) secretes adrenaline.
The ending ‚Äú-ine‚Äù refers to the chemical being derived, or extracted, from the adrenal gland.
A similar construction from Greek instead of Latin results in the word epinephrine (epi- = ‚Äúabove‚Äù; nephr- = ‚Äúkidney‚Äù).
In scientific usage, epinephrine is preferred in the United States, whereas adrenaline is preferred in Great Britain, because ‚Äúadrenalin‚Äù was once a registered, proprietary drug name in the United States.
Though the drug is no longer sold, the convention of referring to this molecule by the two different names persists.
Similarly, norepinephrine and noradrenaline are two names for the same molecule.
Having understood the cholinergic and adrenergic systems, their role in the autonomic system is relatively simple to understand.
All preganglionic fibers, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, release ACh.
All ganglionic neurons‚Äîthe targets of these preganglionic fibers‚Äîhave nicotinic receptors in their cell membranes.
The nicotinic receptor is a ligand- gated cation channel that results in depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.
The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers also release ACh, but the receptors on their targets are muscarinic receptors, which are G protein‚Äìcoupled receptors and do not exclusively cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.
Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, except for fibers that project to sweat glands and to blood vessels associated with skeletal muscles, which release ACh (Table 15.1).

Neurotransmitters are released at synapses, whereas hormones are released into the bloodstream.
These are simplistic definitions, but they can help to clarify this point.
Acetylcholine can be considered a neurotransmitter because it is released by axons at synapses.
The adrenergic system, however, presents a challenge.
Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, which can be considered a neurotransmitter.
But the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into circulation, so they should be considered hormones.
What are referred to here as synapses may not fit the strictest definition of synapse.
Some sources will refer to the connection between a postganglionic fiber and a target effector as neuroeffector junctions; neurotransmitters, as defined above, would be called neuromodulators.
The structure of postganglionic connections are not the typical synaptic end bulb that is found at the neuromuscular junction, but rather are chains of swellings along the length of a postganglionic fiber called avaricosity (Figure 15.5 ).CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 619 Figure 15.5 Autonomic Varicosities The connection between autonomic fibers and target effectors is not the same as the typical synapse, such as the neuromuscular junction.
Instead of a synaptic end bulb, a neurotransmitter is released from swellings along the length of a fiber that makes an extended network of connections in the target effector.
Fight or Flight?
What About Fright and Freeze?
Theoriginalusageoftheepithet‚Äúfightorflight‚ÄùcomesfromascientistnamedWalterCannonwhoworkedatHarvard in 1915.
The concept of homeostasis and the functioning of the sympathetic system had been introduced in France in the previous century.
Cannon expanded the idea, and introduced the idea that an animal responds to a threat by preparing to stand and fight or run away.
The nature of this response was thoroughly explained in a book on the physiology of pain, hunger, fear, and rage.
When students learn about the sympathetic system and the fight-or-flight response, they often stop and wonder aboutotherresponses.Ifyouwerefacedwithalionessrunningtowardyouaspicturedatthebeginningofthischapter, would you run or would you stand your ground?
Some people would say that they would freeze and not know what to do.
So isn‚Äôt there really more to what the autonomic system does than fight, flight, rest, or digest.
What about fear and paralysis in the face of a threat?
The common epithet of ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù is being enlarged to be ‚Äúfight, flight, or fright‚Äù or even ‚Äúfight, flight, fright,orfreeze.‚ÄùCannon‚Äôsoriginalcontributionwasacatchyphrasetoexpresssomeofwhatthenervoussystemdoes in response to a threat, but it is incomplete.
The sympathetic system is responsible for the physiological responses to emotional states.
The name ‚Äúsympathetic‚Äù can be said to mean that (sym- = ‚Äútogether‚Äù; -pathos = ‚Äúpain,‚Äù ‚Äúsuffering,‚Äù or ‚Äúemotion‚Äù).

The main difference between the somatic and autonomic systems is in what target tissues are effectors.
Somatic responses are solely based on skeletal muscle contraction.

The Structure of Reflexes Onedifferencebetweena somaticreflex,suchasthewithdrawalreflex,anda visceralreflex ,whichisanautonomicreflex, is in theefferent branch .
The output of a somatic reflex is the lower motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord that projects directly to a skeletal muscle to cause its contraction.
The output of a visceral reflex is a two-step pathway starting with the preganglionic fiber emerging from a lateral horn neuron in the spinal cord, or a cranial nucleus neuron in thebrainstem,toaganglion‚Äîfollowedbythepostganglionicfiberprojectingtoatargeteffector.Theotherpartofareflex, theafferentbranch,isoftenthesamebetweenthetwosystems.Sensoryneuronsreceivinginputfromtheperiphery‚Äîwith cellbodiesinthesensoryganglia,eitherofacranialnerveoradorsalrootganglionadjacenttothespinalcord‚Äîprojectinto the CNS to initiate the reflex (Figure 15.6).
The Latin root ‚Äúeffere‚Äù means ‚Äúto carry.‚Äù Adding the prefix ‚Äúef-‚Äù suggests the meaning ‚Äúto carry away,‚Äù whereas adding the prefix ‚Äúaf-‚Äù suggests ‚Äúto carry toward or inward.‚ÄùCHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 621 Figure 15.6 Comparison of Somatic and Visceral Reflexes The afferent inputs to somatic and visceral reflexes are essentially the same, whereas the efferent branches are different.
Somatic reflexes, for instance, involve a direct connection from the ventral horn of the spinal cord to the skeletal muscle.
Visceral reflexes involve a projection from the central neuron to a ganglion, followed by a second projection from the ganglion to the target ef fector.
Afferent Branch The afferent branch of a reflex arc does differ between somatic and visceral reflexes in some instances.
Many of the inputs to visceral reflexes are from special or somatic senses, but particular senses are associated with the viscera that are not part oftheconsciousperceptionoftheenvironmentthroughthesomaticnervoussystem.Forexample,thereisaspecifictypeof mechanoreceptor,calleda baroreceptor ,inthewallsoftheaortaandcarotidsinusesthatsensesthestretchofthoseorgans whenbloodvolumeorpressureincreases.Youdonothaveaconsciousperceptionofhavinghighbloodpressure,butthatis an important afferent branch of the cardiovascular and, particularly, vasomotor reflexes.

If you swallow a large bolus of food, for instance, you will probably feel the lump of that food as it pushes through your esophagus, or even if your stomach is distended after a large meal.
If you inhale especially cold air, you can feel it as it enters your larynx and trachea.
These sensations are not the same as feeling high blood pressure or blood sugar levels.
When particularly strong visceral sensations rise to the level of conscious perception, the sensations are often felt in unexpected places.
For example, strong visceral sensations of the heart will be felt as pain in the left shoulder and left arm.
This irregular pattern of projection of conscious perception of visceral sensations is called referred pain.
Depending on the organ system affected, the referred pain will project to different areas of the body (Figure 15.7).
The location of referred pain is not random, but a definitive explanation of the mechanism has not been established.
The most broadly accepted theory for this phenomenon is that the visceral sensory fibers enter into the same level of the spinal cord as the somatosensory fibers of the referred pain location.
By this explanation, the visceral sensory fibers from the mediastinal region, where the heart is located, would enter the spinal cord at the same level as the spinal nerves from the shoulder and arm, so the brain misinterprets the sensations from the mediastinal region as being from the axillary and brachial regions.
Projections from the medial and inferior divisions of the cervical ganglia do enter the spinal cord at the middle to lower cervical levels, which is where the somatosensory fibers enter.
Figure 15.7 Referred Pain Chart Conscious perception of visceral sensations map to specific regions of the body, as shown in this chart.
Some sensations are felt locally, whereas others are perceived as affecting areas that are quite distant from the involved organ.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 623 Nervous System: Kehr‚Äôs Sign Kehr‚Äôssignisthepresentationofpainintheleftshoulder,chest,andneckregionsfollowingruptureofthespleen.The spleen is in the upper-left abdominopelvic quadrant, but the pain is more in the shoulder and neck.
How can this be?
The sympathetic fibers connected to the spleen are from the celiac ganglion, which would be from the mid-thoracic to lower thoracic region whereas parasympathetic fibers are found in the vagus nerve, which connects in the medulla of thebrainstem.However,theneckandshoulderwouldconnecttothespinalcordatthemid-cervicallevelofthespinal cord.
These connections do not fit with the expected correspondence of visceral and somatosensory fibers entering at the same level of the spinal cord.
The incorrect assumption would be that the visceral sensations are coming from the spleen directly.
In fact, the visceral fibers are coming from the diaphragm.
The nerve connecting to the diaphragm takes a special route.
The phrenic nerve is connected to the spinal cord at cervical levels 3 to 5.
The motor fibers that make up this nerve are responsibleforthemusclecontractionsthatdriveventilation.Thesefibershaveleftthespinalcordtoenterthephrenic nerve, meaning that spinal cord damage below the mid-cervical level is not fatal by making ventilation impossible.
Therefore, the visceral fibers from the diaphragm enter the spinal cord at the same level as the somatosensory fibers from the neck and shoulder.
The diaphragm plays a role in Kehr‚Äôs sign because the spleen is just inferior to the diaphragm in the upper- left quadrant of the abdominopelvic cavity.
When the spleen ruptures, blood spills into this region.
The accumulating hemorrhage then puts pressure on the diaphragm.
The visceral sensation is actually in the diaphragm, so the referred pain is in a region of the body that corresponds to the diaphragm, not the spleen.
Efferent Branch The efferent branch of the visceral reflex arc begins with the projection from the central neuron along the preganglionic fiber.
This fiber then makes a synapse on the ganglionic neuron that projects to the target effector.
The effector organs that are the targets of the autonomic system range from the iris and ciliary body of the eye to the urinarybladderandreproductiveorgans.Thethoracolumbaroutput,throughthevarioussympatheticganglia,reachesallof theseorgans.Thecranialcomponentoftheparasympatheticsystemprojectsfromtheeyetopartoftheintestines.Thesacral component picks up with the majority of the large intestine and the pelvic organs of the urinary and reproductive systems.

Visceral reflexes that involve the thoracolumbar or craniosacral systems share similar connections.
However,therearereflexesthatdonotneedtoinvolveanyCNScomponents.A longreflex hasafferentbranchesthatenter the spinal cord or brain and involve the efferent branches, as previously explained.
A short reflex is completely peripheral and only involves the local integration of sensory input with motor output ( Figure 15.8 ).624 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUT ONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 15.8 Short and Long Reflexes Sensory input can stimulate either a short or a long reflex.
A sensory neuron can project to the CNS or to an autonomic ganglion.
The short reflex involves the direct stimulation of a postganglionic fiber by the sensory neuron, whereas the long reflex involves integration in the spinal cord or brain.
The difference between short and long reflexes is in the involvement of the CNS.
Somatic reflexes always involve the CNS, even in a monosynaptic reflex in which the sensory neuron directly activates the motor neuron.
That synapse is in the spinal cord or brain stem, so it has to involve the CNS.
However, in the autonomic system there is the possibility that the CNS is not involved.
Because the efferent branch of a visceral reflex involves two neurons‚Äîthe central neuron and the ganglionic neuron‚Äîa ‚Äúshort circuit‚Äù can be possible.
If a sensory neuron projects directly to the ganglionic neuron and causes it to activate the effector target, then the CNS is not involved.
A division of the nervous system that is related to the autonomic nervous system is the enteric nervous system.
The word enteric refers to the digestive organs, so this represents the nervous tissue that is part of the digestive system.
There are a few myenteric plexuses in which the nervous tissue in the wall of the digestive tract organs can directly influence digestive function.
If stretch receptors in the stomach are activated by the filling and distension of the stomach, a short reflex will directly activate the smooth muscle fibers of the stomach wall to increase motility to digest the excessive food in the stomach.
No CNS involvement is needed because the stretch receptor is directly activating a neuron in the wall of the stomach that causes the smooth muscle to contract.
That neuron, connected to the smooth muscle, is a postganglionic parasympathetic neuron that can be controlled by a fiber found in the vagus nerve.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 625 Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/strokespell) to learn about a teenager who experiences a series of spells that suggest a stroke.

Balance in Competing Autonomic Reflex Arcs The autonomic nervous system is important for homeostasis because its two divisions compete at the target effector.
The balance of homeostasis is attributable to the competing inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions (dual innervation).
At the level of the target effector, the signal of which system is sending the message is strictly chemical.
A signaling molecule binds to a receptor that causes changes in the target cell, which in turn causes the tissue or organ to respond to the changing conditions of the body.
Competing Neurotransmitters The postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions both release neurotransmitters that bind to receptors on their targets.
Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, with a minor exception, whereas postganglionic parasympathetic fibers release ACh.
For any given target, the difference in which division of the autonomic nervous system is exerting control is just in what chemical binds to its receptors.
The target cells will have adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
If norepinephrine is released, it will bind to the adrenergic receptors present on the target cell, and if ACh is released, it will bind to the muscarinic receptors on the tar get cell.
In the sympathetic system, there are exceptions to this pattern of dual innervation.
The postganglionic sympathetic fibersthatcontactthebloodvesselswithinskeletalmuscleandthatcontactsweatglandsdonotreleasenorepinephrine,they releaseACh.Thisdoesnotcreateanyproblembecausethereisnoparasympatheticinputtothesweatglands.Sweatglands have muscarinic receptors and produce and secrete sweat in response to the presence of ACh.
At most of the other targets of the autonomic system, the effector response is based on which neurotransmitter is released and what receptor is present.
For example, regions of the heart that establish heart rate are contacted by postganglionicfibersfrombothsystems.Ifnorepinephrineisreleasedontothosecells,itbindstoanadrenergicreceptorthat causesthecellstodepolarizefaster,andtheheartrateincreases.IfAChisreleasedontothosecells,itbindstoamuscarinic receptorthatcausesthecellstohyperpolarizesothattheycannotreachthresholdaseasily,andtheheartrateslows.Without this parasympathetic input, the heart would work at a rate of approximately 100 beats per minute (bpm).
The sympathetic system speeds that up, as it would during exercise, to 120‚Äì140 bpm, for example.
The parasympathetic system slows it down to the resting heart rate of 60‚Äì80 bpm.
Another example is in the control of pupillary size ( Figure 15.9 ).
The afferent branch responds to light hitting the retina.
Photoreceptors are activated, and the signal is transferred to the retinal ganglion cells that send an action potential along the optic nerve into the diencephalon.
If light levels are low, the sympathetic system sends a signal out through the upperthoracicspinalcordtothesuperiorcervicalganglionofthesympatheticchain.Thepostganglionicfiberthenprojects to the iris, where it releases norepinephrine onto the radial fibers of the iris (a smooth muscle).
When those fibers contract, the pupil dilates‚Äîincreasing the amount of light hitting the retina.
If light levels are too high, the parasympathetic system sends a signal out from the Eddinger‚ÄìWestphal nucleus through the oculomotor nerve.
This fiber synapses in the ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit.
The postganglionic fiber then projects to the iris, where it releases ACh onto the circular fibersoftheiris‚Äîanothersmoothmuscle.Whenthosefiberscontract,thepupilconstrictstolimittheamountoflighthitting the retina.626 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 15.9 Autonomic Control of Pupillary Size Activation of the pupillary reflex comes from the amount of light activating the retinal ganglion cells, as sent along the optic nerve.
The output of the sympathetic system projects through the superior cervical ganglion, whereas the parasympathetic system originates out of the midbrain and projects through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion, which then projects to the iris.
The postganglionic fibers of either division release neurotransmitters onto the smooth muscles of the iris to cause changes in the pupillary size.
Norepinephrine results in dilation and ACh results in constriction.
In this example, the autonomic system is controlling how much light hits the retina.
It is a homeostatic reflex mechanism that keeps the activation of photoreceptors within certain limits.
In the context of avoiding a threat like the lioness on the savannah, the sympathetic response for fight or flight will increase pupillary diameter so that more light hits the retina and more visual information is available for running away.
Likewise, the parasympathetic response of rest reduces the amount of light reaching the retina, allowing the photoreceptors to cycle through bleaching and be regenerated for further visual perception; this is what the homeostatic process is attempting to maintain.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 627 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/pupillary) to learn about the pupillary reflexes.
The pupillary light reflex involves sensory input through the optic nerve and motor response through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion,whichprojectstothecircularfibersoftheiris.Asshowninthisshortanimation,pupilswillconstricttolimit the amount of light falling on the retina under bright lighting conditions.
What constitutes the afferent and efferent branches of the competing reflex (dilation)?
Autonomic Tone Organsystemsarebalancedbetweentheinputfromthesympatheticandparasympatheticdivisions.Whensomethingupsets that balance, the homeostatic mechanisms strive to return it to its regular state.
For each organ system, there may be more of a sympathetic or parasympathetic tendency to the resting state, which is known as the autonomic tone of the system.
For example, the heart rate was described above.
Because the resting heart rate is the result of the parasympathetic system slowing the heart down from its intrinsic rate of 100 bpm, the heart can be said to be in parasympathetic tone.
In a similar fashion, another aspect of the cardiovascular system is primarily under sympathetic control.
Blood pressure is partially determined by the contraction of smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels.
These tissues have adrenergic receptors that respond to the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic fibers by constricting and increasing blood pressure.
The hormones released from the adrenal medulla‚Äîepinephrine and norepinephrine‚Äîwill also bind to these receptors.
Those hormones travel through the bloodstream where they can easily interact with the receptors in the vessel walls.
The parasympathetic system has no significant input to the systemic blood vessels, so the sympathetic system determines their tone.
There are a limited number of blood vessels that respond to sympathetic input in a different fashion.
Blood vessels in skeletal muscle, particularly those in the lower limbs, are more likely to dilate.
It does not have an overall effect on blood pressure to alter the tone of the vessels, but rather allows for blood flow to increase for those skeletal muscles that will be active in the fight-or-flight response.
The blood vessels that have a parasympathetic projection are limited to those in the erectile tissue of the reproductive organs.
Acetylcholine released by these postganglionic parasympathetic fibers cause the vessels to dilate, leading to the engorgement of the erectile tissue.628 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Orthostatic Hypotension Have you ever stood up quickly and felt dizzy for a moment?
This is because, for one reason or another, blood is not getting to your brain so it is briefly deprived of oxygen.
When you change position from sitting or lying down to standing,yourcardiovascularsystemhastoadjustforanewchallenge,keepingbloodpumpingupintotheheadwhile gravity is pulling more and more blood down into the legs.
The reason for this is a sympathetic reflex that maintains the output of the heart in response to postural change.
When a person stands up, proprioceptors indicate that the body is changing position.
A signal goes to the CNS, which then sends a signal to the upper thoracic spinal cord neurons of the sympathetic division.
The sympathetic system then causes the heart to beat faster and the blood vessels to constrict.
Both changes will make it possible for the cardiovascular system to maintain the rate of blood delivery to the brain.
Blood is being pumped superiorly through the internal branch of the carotid arteries into the brain, against the force of gravity.
Gravity is not increasing while standing,butbloodismorelikelytoflowdownintothelegsastheyareextendedforstanding.Thissympatheticreflex keeps the brain well oxygenated so that cognitive and other neural processes are not interrupted.
Sometimes this does not work properly.
If the sympathetic system cannot increase cardiac output, then blood pressureintothebrainwilldecrease,andabriefneurologicallosscanbefelt.Thiscanbebrief,asaslight‚Äúwooziness‚Äù whenstandinguptooquickly,oralossofbalanceandneurologicalimpairmentforaperiodoftime.Thenameforthis is orthostatic hypotension, which means that blood pressure goes below the homeostatic set point when standing.
It can be the result of standing up faster than the reflex can occur, which may be referred to as a benign ‚Äúhead rush,‚Äù or it may be the result of an underlying cause.
There are two basic reasons that orthostatic hypotension can occur.
First, blood volume is too low and the sympathetic reflex is not effective.
This hypovolemia may be the result of dehydration or medications that affect fluid balance, such as diuretics or vasodilators.
Both of these medications are meant to lower blood pressure, which may be necessary in the case of systemic hypertension, and regulation of the medications may alleviate the problem.
Sometimes increasing fluid intake or water retention through salt intake can improve the situation.
The second underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension is autonomic failure.
There are several disorders that result in compromised sympathetic functions.
The disorders range from diabetes to multiple system atrophy (a loss of control over many systems in the body), and addressing the underlying condition can improve the hypotension.
For example,withdiabetes,peripheralnervedamagecanoccur,whichwouldaffectthepostganglionicsympatheticfibers.
Getting blood glucose levels under control can improve neurological deficits associated with diabetes.
15.3|Central Control By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the role of higher centers of the brain in autonomic regulation ‚Ä¢Explain the connection of the hypothalamus to homeostasis ‚Ä¢Describe the regions of the CNS that link the autonomic system with emotion ‚Ä¢Describe the pathways important to descending control of the autonomic system Thepupillarylightreflex(Figure15.10)beginswhenlighthitstheretinaandcausesasignaltotravelalongtheopticnerve.
This is visual sensation, because the afferent branch of this reflex is simply sharing the special sense pathway.
Bright light hittingtheretinaleadstotheparasympatheticresponse,throughtheoculomotornerve,followedbythepostganglionicfiber from the ciliary ganglion, which stimulates the circular fibers of the iris to contract and constrict the pupil.
When light hits the retina in one eye, both pupils contract.
When that light is removed, both pupils dilate again back to the resting position.
When the stimulus is unilateral (presented to only one eye), the response is bilateral (both eyes).
The same is not true for somatic reflexes.
If you touch a hot radiator, you only pull that arm back, not both.
Central control of autonomic reflexes is different than for somatic reflexes.
The hypothalamus, along with other CNS locations, controls the autonomic system.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 629 Figure 15.10 Pupillary Reflex Pathways The pupil is under competing autonomic control in response to light levels hitting the retina.
The sympathetic system will dilate the pupil when the retina is not receiving enough light, and the parasympathetic system will constrict the pupil when too much light hits the retina.
Forebrain Structures Autonomic control is based on the visceral reflexes, composed of the afferent and efferent branches.
These homeostatic mechanisms are based on the balance between the two divisions of the autonomic system, which results in tone for various organs that is based on the predominant input from the sympathetic or parasympathetic systems.
Coordinating that balance requiresintegrationthatbeginswithforebrainstructureslikethehypothalamusandcontinuesintothebrainstemandspinal cord.
The Hypothalamus The hypothalamus is the control center for many homeostatic mechanisms.
It regulates both autonomic function and endocrinefunction.
The roles it plays in the pupillaryreflexes demonstratesthe importanceof this control center.
The optic nerveprojectsprimarilytothethalamus,whichisthenecessaryrelaytotheoccipitalcortexforconsciousvisualperception.
Another projection of the optic nerve, however, goes to the hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus then uses this visual system input to drive the pupillary reflexes.
If the retina is activated by high levels of light, the hypothalamus stimulates the parasympathetic response.
If the optic nerve message shows that low levels of light are falling on the retina, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic response.
Output from the hypothalamus follows two main tracts, the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus and themedial forebrain bundle (Figure 15.11).
Along these two tracts, the hypothalamus can influence the Eddinger‚ÄìWestphal nucleus of the oculomotor complex or the lateral horns of the thoracic spinal cord.630 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 15.11 Fiber Tracts of the Central Autonomic System The hypothalamus is the source of most of the central control of autonomic function.
It receives input from cerebral structures and projects to brain stem and spinal cord structures to regulate the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the organ systems of the body.
The main pathways for this are the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus.
These two tracts connect the hypothalamus with the major parasympathetic nuclei in the brain stem and the preganglionic (central) neurons of the thoracolumbar spinal cord.
The hypothalamus also receives input from other areas of the forebrain through the medial forebrain bundle.
The olfactory cortex, the septal nuclei of the basal forebrain, and the amygdala project into the hypothalamus through the medial forebrain bundle.
These forebrain structures inform the hypothalamus about the state of the nervous system and can influence the regulatory processes of homeostasis.
A good example of this is found in the amygdala, which is found beneath the cerebral cortex of the temporal lobe and plays a role in our ability to remember and feel emotions.
The Amygdala The amygdala is a group of nuclei in the medial region of the temporal lobe that is part of the limbic lobe (Figure 15.12).
Thelimbiclobeincludesstructuresthatareinvolvedinemotionalresponses,aswellasstructuresthatcontributetomemory function.Thelimbiclobehasstrongconnectionswiththehypothalamusandinfluencesthestateofitsactivityonthebasisof emotionalstate.Forexample,whenyouareanxiousorscared,theamygdalawillsendsignalstothehypothalamusalongthe medial forebrain bundle that will stimulate the sympathetic fight-or-flight response.
The hypothalamus will also stimulate the release of stress hormones through its control of the endocrine system in response to amygdala input.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 631 Figure 15.12 The Limbic Lobe Structures arranged around the edge of the cerebrum constitute the limbic lobe, which includes the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus, and connects to the hypothalamus.
The Medulla The medulla contains nuclei referred to as the cardiovascular center, which controls the smooth and cardiac muscle of the cardiovascular system through autonomic connections.
When the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system shifts, such as when blood pressure changes, the coordination of the autonomic system can be accomplished within this region.
Furthermore, when descending inputs from the hypothalamus stimulate this area, the sympathetic system can increase activity in the cardiovascular system, such as in response to anxiety or stress.
The preganglionic sympathetic fibers that are responsible for increasing heart rate are referred to as the cardiac accelerator nerves, whereas the preganglionic sympathetic fibers responsible for constricting blood vessels compose the vasomotor nerves.
Several brain stem nuclei are important for the visceral control of major organ systems.
One brain stem nucleus involved in cardiovascular function is the solitary nucleus.
It receives sensory input about blood pressure and cardiac function from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, and its output will activate sympathetic stimulation of the heart or bloodvesselsthroughtheupperthoraciclateralhorn.Anotherbrainstemnucleusimportantforvisceralcontrolisthedorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which is the motor nucleus for the parasympathetic functions ascribed to the vagus nerve, including decreasing the heart rate, relaxing bronchial tubes in the lungs, and activating digestive function through the enteric nervous system.
The nucleus ambiguus, which is named for its ambiguous histology, also contributes to the parasympathetic output of the vagus nerve and targets muscles in the pharynx and larynx for swallowing and speech, as well as contributing to the parasympathetic tone of the heart along with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.632 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Exercise and the Autonomic System In addition to its association with the fight-or-flight response and rest-and-digest functions, the autonomic system is responsible for certain everyday functions.
For example, it comes into play when homeostatic mechanisms dynamically change, such as the physiological changes that accompany exercise.
Getting on the treadmill and putting in a good workout will cause the heart rate to increase, breathing to be stronger and deeper, sweat glands to activate, and the digestive system to suspend activity.
These are the same physiological changes associated with the fight-or- flight response, but there is nothing chasing you on that treadmill.
Thisisnotasimplehomeostaticmechanismatworkbecause‚Äúmaintainingtheinternalenvironment‚Äùwouldmean gettingallthosechangesbacktotheirsetpoints.Instead,thesympatheticsystemhasbecomeactiveduringexerciseso that your body can cope with what is happening.
A homeostatic mechanism is dealing with the conscious decision to push the body away from a resting state.
The heart, actually, is moving away from its homeostatic set point.

You could say that the body is stressed because of what you are doing to it.
Homeostatic mechanismsare trying to keep blood pH in the normal range, or to keep body temperatureunder control, but those are in response to the choice to exercise.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/emotions) to learn about physical responses to emotion.
The autonomic system, which is important for regulating the homeostasis of the organ systems, is also responsible for our physiological responses to emotions such as fear.
The video summarizes the extent of the body‚Äôs reactions and describes several effects of the autonomic system in response to fear.
On the basis of what you have already studied about autonomic function, which effect would you expect to be associated with parasympathetic, rather than sympathetic, activity?
15.4|Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢List the classes of pharmaceuticals that interact with the autonomic nervous system ‚Ä¢Differentiate between cholinergic and adrenergic compounds ‚Ä¢Differentiate between sympathomimetic and sympatholytic drugs ‚Ä¢Relate the consequences of nicotine abuse with respect to autonomic control of the cardiovascular system An important way to understand the effects of native neurochemicals in the autonomic system is in considering the effects of pharmaceutical drugs.
This can be considered in terms of how drugs change autonomic function.
These effects will primarily be based on how drugs act at the receptors of the autonomic system neurochemistry.
The signaling molecules of the nervous system interact with proteins in the cell membranes of various target cells.
In fact, no effect can be attributed to just the signaling molecules themselves without considering the receptors.
A chemical that the body produces to interact with those receptors is called an endogenous chemical , whereas a chemical introduced to the system from outside is an exogenouschemical.Exogenouschemicalsmaybeofanaturalorigin,suchasaplantextract,ortheymaybesynthetically produced in a pharmaceutical laboratory.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 633 Broad Autonomic Effects One importantdrug thataffectstheautonomicsystembroadlyis notapharmaceuticaltherapeuticagentassociatedwiththe system.Thisdrugisnicotine.Theeffectsofnicotineontheautonomicnervoussystemareimportantinconsideringtherole smoking can play in health.
All ganglionic neurons of the autonomic system, in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, are activated by AChreleasedfrompreganglionicfibers.TheAChreceptorsontheseneuronsareofthenicotinictype,meaningthattheyare ligand-gated ion channels.
When the neurotransmitter released from the preganglionic fiber binds to the receptor protein, a channel opens to allow positive ions to cross the cell membrane.
The result is depolarization of the ganglia.
Nicotine acts as an ACh analog at these synapses, so when someone takes in the drug, it binds to these ACh receptors and activates the ganglionic neurons, causing them to depolarize.
Ganglia of both divisions are activated equally by the drug.
For many target organs in the body, this results in no net change.
The competing inputs to the system cancel each other out and nothing significant happens.
For example, the sympathetic system will cause sphincters in the digestive tract to contract, limiting digestive propulsion, but the parasympatheticsystemwillcausethecontractionofothermusclesinthedigestivetract,whichwilltrytopushthecontents of the digestive system along.
The end result is that the food does not really move along and the digestive system has not appreciably changed.
The system in which this can be problematicis in thecardiovascularsystem, which is why smoking is a risk factorfor cardiovasculardisease.First,thereisnosignificantparasympatheticregulationofbloodpressure.Onlyalimitednumberof blood vessels are affected by parasympathetic input, so nicotine will preferentially cause the vascular tone to become more sympathetic, which means blood pressure will be increased.
Second, the autonomic control of the heart is special.
Unlike skeletal or smooth muscles, cardiac muscle is intrinsically active, meaning that it generates its own action potentials.
The autonomic system does not cause the heart to beat, it just speeds it up (sympathetic) or slows it down (parasympathetic).
The mechanisms for this are not mutually exclusive, so the heart receives conflicting signals, and the rhythm of the heart can be affected (Figure 15.13 ).
Figure15.13AutonomicConnectionstoHeartandBloodVessels The nicotinic receptor is found on all autonomic ganglia, but the cardiovascular connections are particular, and do not conform to the usual competitive projections that would just cancel each other out when stimulated by nicotine.
The opposing signals to the heart would both depolarize and hyperpolarize the heart cells that establish the rhythm of the heartbeat, likely causing arrhythmia.
Only the sympathetic system governs systemic blood pressure so nicotine would cause an increase.634 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Sympathetic Effect Theneurochemistryofthesympatheticsystemisbasedontheadrenergicsystem.Norepinephrineandepinephrineinfluence target effectors by binding to the Œ±-adrenergic or Œ≤-adrenergic receptors.
Drugs that affect the sympathetic system affect these chemical systems.
The drugs can be classified by whether they enhance the functions of the sympathetic system or interrupt those functions.
A drug that enhances adrenergic function is known as a sympathomimetic drug, whereas a drug that interrupts adrenergic function is a sympatholytic drug.
Sympathomimetic Drugs When the sympathetic system is not functioning correctly or the body is in a state of homeostatic imbalance, these drugs act at postganglionic terminals and synapses in the sympathetic efferent pathway.
These drugs either bind to particular adrenergic receptors and mimic norepinephrine at the synapses between sympathetic postganglionic fibers and their targets, or they increase the production and release of norepinephrine from postganglionic fibers.
Also, to increase the effectiveness of adrenergic chemicals released from the fibers, some of these drugs may block the removal or reuptake of the neurotransmitter from the synapse.
A common sympathomimetic drug is phenylephrine, which is a common component of decongestants.
It can also be used to dilate the pupil and to raise blood pressure.
Phenylephrine is known as an Œ± 1-adrenergic agonist, meaning that it binds to a specific adrenergic receptor, stimulating a response.
In this role, phenylephrine will bind to the adrenergic receptors in bronchioles of the lungs and cause them to dilate.
By opening these structures, accumulated mucus can be cleared out of the lower respiratory tract.
Phenylephrine is often paired with other pharmaceuticals, such as analgesics, as in the ‚Äúsinus‚Äù version of many over-the-counter drugs, such as Tylenol Sinus¬Æor Excedrin Sinus¬Æ, or in expectorants for chest congestion such as in Robitussin CF¬Æ.
A related molecule, called pseudoephedrine, was much more commonly used in these applications than was phenylephrine,untilthemoleculebecameusefulintheillicitproductionofamphetamines.Phenylephrineisnotaseffective asadrugbecauseitcanbepartiallybrokendowninthedigestivetractbeforeitiseverabsorbed.Liketheadrenergicagents, phenylephrine is effective in dilating the pupil, known as mydriasis (Figure 15.14).
Phenylephrine is used during an eye exam in an ophthalmologist‚Äôs or optometrist‚Äôs office for this purpose.
It can also be used to increase blood pressure in situations in which cardiac function is compromised, such as under anesthesia or during septic shock.
Figure 15.14 Mydriasis The sympathetic system causes pupillary dilation when norepinephrine binds to an adrenergic receptor in the radial fibers of the iris smooth muscle.
Phenylephrine mimics this action by binding to the same receptor when drops are applied onto the surface of the eye in a doctor ‚Äôs office.
(credit: Corey Theiss) Other drugs that enhance adrenergic function are not associated with therapeutic uses, but affect the functions of the sympathetic system in a similar fashion.
Cocaine primarily interferes with the uptake of dopamine at the synapse and can also increase adrenergic function.
Caffeine is an antagonist to a different neurotransmitter receptor, called the adenosine receptor.
Adenosine will suppress adrenergic activity, specifically the release of norepinephrine at synapses, so caffeine indirectlyincreasesadrenergicactivity.Thereissomeevidencethatcaffeinecanaidinthetherapeuticuseofdrugs,perhaps bypotentiating(increasing)sympatheticfunction,asissuggestedbytheinclusionofcaffeineinover-the-counteranalgesics such as Excedrin¬Æ.
Sympatholytic Drugs Drugs that interfere with sympathetic function are referred to as sympatholytic, or sympathoplegic, drugs.
They primarily work as an antagonist to the adrenergic receptors.
They block the ability of norepinephrine or epinephrine to bind to theCHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 635 receptorssothattheeffectis‚Äúcut‚Äùor‚Äútakesablow,‚Äùtorefertotheendings‚Äú-lytic‚Äùand‚Äú-plegic,‚Äùrespectively.Thevarious drugs of this class will be specific to Œ±-adrenergic or Œ≤-adrenergic receptors, or to their receptor subtypes.
Possibly the most familiar type of sympatholytic drug are the Œ≤-blockers.
These drugs are often used to treat cardiovascular disease because they block the Œ≤-receptors associated with vasoconstriction and cardioacceleration.
By allowing blood vessels to dilate, or keeping heart rate from increasing, these drugs can improve cardiac function in a compromised system, such as for a person with congestive heart failure or who has previously suffered a heart attack.
A couple of common versions of Œ≤-blockers are metaprolol, which specifically blocks the Œ≤ 2-receptor, and propanolol, which nonspecifically blocks Œ≤-receptors.
There are other drugs that are Œ±-blockers and can affect the sympathetic system in a similar way.
Otherusesforsympatholyticdrugsareasantianxietymedications.Acommonexampleofthisisclonidine,whichisan Œ±-blocker.
The sympathetic system is tied to anxiety to the point that the sympathetic response can be referred to as ‚Äúfight, flight, or fright.‚Äù Clonidine is used for other treatments aside from hypertension and anxiety, including pain conditions and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Parasympathetic Effects Drugs affecting parasympathetic functions can be classified into those that increase or decrease activity at postganglionic terminals.
Parasympathetic postganglionic fibers release ACh, and the receptors on the targets are muscarinic receptors.
There are several types of muscarinic receptors, M1‚ÄìM5, but the drugs are not usually specific to the specific types.
Parasympathetic drugs can be either muscarinic agonists or antagonists, or have indirect effects on the cholinergic system.
Drugs that enhance cholinergic effects are called parasympathomimetic drugs, whereas those that inhibit cholinergic effects are referred to as anticholinergic drugs .
Pilocarpineisanonspecificmuscarinicagonistcommonlyusedtotreatdisordersoftheeye.Itreversesmydriasis,such as is caused by phenylephrine, and can be administered after an eye exam.
Along with constricting the pupil through the smooth muscle of the iris, pilocarpine will also cause the ciliary muscle to contract.
This will open perforations at the base ofthecornea,allowingforthedrainageofaqueoushumorfromtheanteriorcompartmentoftheeyeand,therefore,reducing intraocular pressure related to glaucoma.
Atropine and scopolamine are part of a class of muscarinic antagonists that come from the Atropagenus of plants that include belladonna or deadly nightshade (Figure 15.15).
The name of one of these plants, belladonna, refers to the fact that extracts from this plant were used cosmetically for dilating the pupil.

Connections between regions in the brain stem and the autonomic system result in the symptoms of nausea, cold sweats, and vomiting.
The part of the brain responsible for vomiting, or emesis, is known as the area postrema.
It is located next to the fourth ventricle and is not restricted by the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, which allows it to respond to chemicals in the bloodstream‚Äînamely, toxins that will stimulate emesis.
There are significant connections between this area, the solitary nucleus, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve.
These autonomic system and nuclei connections are associated with the symptoms of motion sickness.
Motion sickness is the result of conflicting information from the visual and vestibular systems.
If motion is perceived by the visual system without the complementary vestibular stimuli, or through vestibular stimuli without visual confirmation, the brain stimulates emesis and the associated symptoms.
The area postrema, by itself, appears to beabletostimulateemesisinresponsetotoxinsintheblood,butitisalsoconnectedtotheautonomicsystemandcan trigger a similar response to motion.
Autonomic drugs are used to combat motion sickness.
Though it is often described as a dangerous and deadly drug, scopolamine is used to treat motion sickness.
A popular treatment for motion sickness is the transdermal scopolaminepatch.Scopolamineisoneofthesubstancesderivedfromthe Atropagenusalongwithatropine.Athigher doses, those substances are thought to be poisonous and can lead to an extreme sympathetic syndrome.
However, the transdermal patch regulates the release of the drug, and the concentration is kept very low so that the dangers are avoided.
For those who are concerned about using ‚ÄúThe Most Dangerous Drug,‚Äù as some websites will call it, antihistamines such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine¬Æ) can be used.CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 637 Watchthis video(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/3Dmovies) tolearnaboutthesideeffectsof3-Dmovies.Asdiscussed in this video, movies that are shot in 3-D can cause motion sickness, which elicits the autonomic symptoms of nausea andsweating.Thedisconnectionbetweentheperceivedmotiononthescreenandthelackofanychangeinequilibrium stimulates these symptoms.

sympathetic fiber CHAPTER REVIEW 15.1 Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System The primary responsibilities of the autonomic nervous system are to regulate homeostatic mechanisms in the body, which is also part of what the endocrine system does.
The key to understanding the autonomic system is to explore the response pathways‚Äîthe output of the nervous system.
The way we respond to the world around us, to manage the internal environment on the basis of the external environment, is divided between two parts of the autonomic nervous system.
The sympathetic division responds to threats and produces a readiness to confront the threat or to run away: the fight-or-CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 641 flight response.
The parasympathetic division plays the opposite role.
When the external environment does not present any immediate danger, a restful mode descends on the body, and the digestive system is more active.
The sympathetic output of the nervous system originates out of the lateral horn of the thoracolumbar spinal cord.
An axon from one of these central neurons projects by way of the ventral spinal nerve root and spinal nerve to a sympathetic ganglion,eitherinthesympatheticchaingangliaoroneofthecollaterallocations,whereitsynapsesonaganglionicneuron.
These preganglionicfibers release ACh, which excitesthe ganglionicneuron through the nicotinicreceptor.
The axon from the ganglionic neuron‚Äîthe postganglionic fiber‚Äîthen projects to a target effector where it will release norepinephrine to bind to an adrenergic receptor, causing a change in the physiology of that organ in keeping with the broad, divergent sympathetic response.
The postganglionic connections to sweat glands in the skin and blood vessels supplying skeletal muscle are, however, exceptions; those fibers release ACh onto muscarinic receptors.
The sympathetic system has a specialized preganglionic connection to the adrenal medulla that causes epinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into the bloodstream rather than exciting a neuron that contacts an organ directly.
This hormonal component means that the sympathetic chemical signal can spread throughout the body very quickly and af fect many organ systems at once.
The parasympathetic output is based in the brain stem and sacral spinal cord.
Neurons from particular nuclei in the brainstemorfromthelateralhornofthesacralspinalcord(preganglionicneurons)projecttoterminal(intramural)ganglia located close to or within the wall of target effectors.
These preganglionic fibers also release ACh onto nicotinic receptors to excite the ganglionic neurons.
The postganglionic fibers then contact the target tissues within the organ to release ACh, which binds to muscarinic receptors to induce rest-and-digest responses.
Signaling molecules utilized by the autonomic nervous system are released from axons and can be considered as either neurotransmitters (when they directly interact with the effector) or as hormones (when they are released into the bloodstream).
The same molecule, such as norepinephrine, could be considered either a neurotransmitter or a hormone on the basis of whether it is released from a postganglionic sympathetic axon or from the adrenal gland.
The synapses in the autonomic system are not always the typical type of connection first described in the neuromuscular junction.
Instead of havingsynapticendbulbsattheveryendofanaxonalfiber,theymayhaveswellings‚Äîcalledvaricosities‚Äîalongthelength of a fiber so that it makes a network of connections within the tar get tissue.
15.2 Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis Autonomic nervous system function is based on the visceral reflex.
This reflex is similar to the somatic reflex, but the efferent branch is composed of two neurons.
The central neuron projects from the spinal cord or brain stem to synapse on theganglionicneuronthatprojectstotheeffector.Theafferentbranchofthesomaticandvisceralreflexesisverysimilar,as many somatic and special senses activate autonomic responses.
However, there are visceral senses that do not form part of consciousperception.Ifavisceralsensation,suchascardiacpain,isstrongenough,itwillrisetothelevelofconsciousness.
However, the sensory homunculus does not provide a representation of the internal structures to the same degree as the surfaceofthebody,sovisceralsensationsareoftenexperiencedasreferredpain,suchasfeelingsofpainintheleftshoulder and arm in connection with a heart attack.
The role of visceral reflexes is to maintain a balance of function in the organ systems of the body.
The two divisions of the autonomic system each play a role in effecting change, usually in competing directions.
The sympathetic system increases heart rate, whereas the parasympathetic system decreases heart rate.

The heart rate is slowed by the autonomic system at rest, whereas blood vessels retain a slight constriction at rest.
In a few systems of the body, the competing input from the two divisions is not the norm.
The sympathetic tone of bloodvesselsiscausedbythelackofparasympatheticinputtothesystemiccirculatorysystem.Onlycertainregionsreceive parasympathetic input that relaxes the smooth muscle wall of the blood vessels.
Sweat glands are another example, which only receive input from the sympathetic system.
15.3 Central Control The autonomic system integrates sensory information and higher cognitive processes to generate output, which balances homeostatic mechanisms.
The central autonomic structure is the hypothalamus, which coordinates sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways to regulate activities of the organ systems of the body.
The majority of hypothalamic output travels through the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus to influence brain stem and spinal components of the autonomic nervous system.
The medial forebrain bundle also connects the hypothalamus with higher centers of the limbic system where emotion can influence visceral responses.
The amygdala is a structure within the limbic system that influences the hypothalamus in the regulation of the autonomic system, as well as the endocrine system.
These higher centers have descending control of the autonomic system through brain stem centers, primarily in the medulla, such as the cardiovascular center.
This collection of medullary nuclei regulates cardiac function, as well as blood pressure.
Sensory input from the heart, aorta, and carotid sinuses project to these regions of the medulla.
The solitary nucleusincreasessympathetictoneofthecardiovascularsystemthroughthecardiacacceleratorandvasomotornerves.The nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus both contribute fibers to the vagus nerve, which exerts parasympathetic control of the heart by decreasing heart rate.642 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 15.4 Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System The autonomic system is affected by a number of exogenous agents, including some that are therapeutic and some that are illicit.
These drugs affect the autonomic system by mimicking or interfering with the endogenous agents or their receptors.
A survey of how different drugs affect autonomic function illustrates the role that the neurotransmitters and hormones play inautonomicfunction.Drugscanbethoughtofaschemicaltoolstoeffectchangesinthesystemwithsomeprecision,based on where those drugs are effective.
Nicotine is not a drug that is used therapeutically, except for smoking cessation.
When it is introduced into the body via products, it has broad effects on the autonomic system.
Nicotine carries a risk for cardiovascular disease because of these broad effects.
The drug stimulates both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia at the preganglionic fiber synapse.
For most organ systems in the body, the competing input from the two postganglionic fibers will essentially cancel each other out.
However, for the cardiovascular system, the results are different.
Because there is essentially no parasympathetic influence on blood pressure for the entire body, the sympathetic input is increased by nicotine, causing an increase in blood pressure.
Also, the influence that the autonomic system has on the heart is not the same as for other systems.
Other organs have smooth muscle or glandular tissue that is activated or inhibited by the autonomic system.
Cardiac muscle is intrinsically active and is modulated by the autonomic system.
The contradictory signals do not just cancel each other out, they alter the regularity of the heart rate and can cause arrhythmias.
Both hypertension and arrhythmias are risk factors for heart disease.

One part of the exam is the inspection of the oral cavity and pharynx, which enables the doctor to not only inspect the tissues for signs of infection, but also provides a means to test the functions of the cranial nerves associated with the oral cavity .
(credit: U.S. Department of Defense) Introduction Chapter Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the major sections of the neurological exam ‚Ä¢Outline the benefits of rapidly assessing neurological function ‚Ä¢Relate anatomical structures of the nervous system to specific functions ‚Ä¢Diagram the connections of the nervous system to the musculature and integument involved in primary sensorimotor responses ‚Ä¢Compare and contrast the somatic and visceral reflexes with respect to how they are assessed through the neurological exam A man arrives at the hospital after feeling faint and complaining of a ‚Äúpins-and-needles‚Äù feeling all along one side of his body.
The most likely explanation is that he has suffered a stroke, which has caused a loss of oxygen to a particular part ofCHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 647 the central nervous system (CNS).
The problem is finding where in the entire nervous system the stroke has occurred.
By checking reflexes, sensory responses, and motor control, a health care provider can focus on what abilities the patient may have lost as a result of the stroke and can use this information to determine where the injury occurred.
In the emergency department of the hospital, this kind of rapid assessment of neurological function is key to treating trauma to the nervous system.
In the classroom, the neurological exam is a valuable tool for learning the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system because it allows you to relate the functions of the system to particular locations in the nervous system.
As a student of anatomy and physiology, you may be planning to go into an allied health field, perhaps nursing or physical therapy.
You could be in the emergency department treating a patient such as the one just described.
An important part of this course is to understand the nervous system.
This can be especially challenging because you need to learn about the nervous system using your own nervous system.
The first chapter in this unit about the nervous system began with a quote: ‚ÄúIf the human brain were simple enough for us to understand, we would be too simple to understand it.‚Äù However, you are being asked to understand aspects of it.
A healthcare provider can pinpoint problems with the nervous system in minutes by running through the series of tasks to test neurological function that are described in this chapter.
You can use the same approach, though not as quickly, to learn about neurological function and its relationship to the structures of the nervous system.
Nervous tissue is different from other tissues in that it is not classified into separate tissue types.
It does contain two typesofcells,neuronsandglia,butitisalljustnervoustissue.Whitematterandgraymatterarenottypesofnervoustissue, but indications of different specializations within the nervous tissue.
However, not all nervous tissue performs the same function.Furthermore,specificfunctionsarenotwhollylocalizedtoindividualbrainstructuresinthewaythatotherbodily functions occur strictly within specific organs.
In the CNS, we must consider the connections between cells over broad areas, not just the function of cells in one particular nucleus or region.
In a broad sense, the nervous system is responsible for the majority of electrochemical signaling in the body, but the use of those signals is different in various regions.
Thenervoussystemismadeupofthebrainandspinalcordasthecentralorgans,andthegangliaandnervesasorgans in the periphery.
The brain and spinal cord can be thought of as a collection of smaller organs, most of which would be the nuclei (such as the oculomotor nuclei), but white matter structures play an important role (such as the corpus callosum).
Studying the nervous system requires an understanding of the varied physiology of the nervous system.
For example, the hypothalamus plays a very different role than the visual cortex.
The neurological exam provides a way to elicit behavior that represents those varied functions.
16.1|Overview of the Neurological Exam By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢List the major sections of the neurological exam ‚Ä¢Explain the connection between location and function in the nervous system ‚Ä¢Explain the benefit of a rapid assessment for neurological function in a clinical setting ‚Ä¢List the causes of neurological deficits ‚Ä¢Describe the different ischemic events in the nervous system Theneurological exam is a clinical assessment tool used to determine what specific parts of the CNS are affected by damage or disease.
It can be performed in a short time‚Äîsometimes as quickly as 5 minutes‚Äîto establish neurological function.
In the emergency department, this rapid assessment can make the difference with respect to proper treatment and the extent of recovery that is possible.
The exam is a series of subtests separated into five major sections.
The first of these is the mental status exam, which assesses the higher cognitive functions such as memory, orientation, and language.
Then there is the cranial nerve exam, which tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves and, therefore, the central and peripheral structures associated with them.
The cranial nerve exam tests the sensory and motor functions of each of the nerves, as applicable.
Two major sections,the sensoryexam andthemotorexam,testthesensoryandmotorfunctionsassociatedwithspinalnerves.Finally, thecoordination exam tests the ability to perform complex and coordinated movements.
The gait exam, which is often considered a sixth major exam, specifically assesses the motor function of walking and can be considered part of the coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement.

Several of the subtests examine language function.
Deficits in neurological function uncovered by these examinations usually point to damage to the left cerebral cortex.
In the majority of individuals, language function is localized to the left hemisphere between the superior temporal lobe and the posterior frontal lobe, including the intervening connections through the inferior parietal lobe.648 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The five major sections of the neurological exam are related to the major regions of the CNS (Figure 16.2).
The mental status exam assesses functions related to the cerebrum.
The cranial nerve exam is for the nerves that connect to the diencephalon and brain stem (as well as the olfactory connections to the forebrain).

Figure 16.2 Anatomical Underpinnings of the Neurological Exam The different regions of the CNS relate to the major sections of the neurological exam: the mental status exam, cranial nerve exam, sensory exam, motor exam, and coordination exam (including the gait exam).
Part of the power of the neurological exam is this link between structure and function.
Testing the various functions represented in the exam allows an accurate estimation of where the nervous system may be damaged.
Consider the patient described in the chapter introduction.
In the emergency department, he is given a quick exam to find where the deficit may be localized.
Knowledge of where the damage occurred will lead to the most ef fective therapy.
In rapid succession, he is asked to smile, raise his eyebrows, stick out his tongue, and shrug his shoulders.
The doctor tests muscular strength by providing resistance against his arms and legs while he tries to lift them.
With his eyes closed, he has to indicate when he feels the tip of a pen touch his legs, arms, fingers, and face.
He follows the tip of a pen as the doctormovesitthroughthevisualfieldandfinallytowardhisface.Aformalmentalstatusexamisnotneededatthispoint; the patient will demonstrate any possible deficits in that area during normal interactions with the interviewer.

The patient reports that he feels pins and needles in his left arm and leg, and has trouble feeling the tip of the pen when he is touched on those limbs.
This suggests a problem with the sensory systems between the spinal cord and the brain.
The emergency department has a lead to follow before a CT scan is performed.
He is put on aspirin therapy to limit the possibility of blood clots forming, in case the cause is an embolus‚Äîan obstruction such as a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood in an artery or vein.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 649 Watchthis video(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neuroexam) toseeademonstrationoftheneurologicalexam‚Äîaseries of tests that can be performed rapidly when a patient is initially brought into an emergency department.
The exam can be repeated on a regular basis to keep a record of how and if neurological function changes over time.
In what order were the sections of the neurological exam tested in this video, and which section seemed to be left out?
Causes of Neurological Deficits Damage to the nervous system can be limited to individual structures or can be distributed across broad areas of the brain and spinal cord.
Localized, limited injury to the nervous system is most often the result of circulatory problems.
Neurons are very sensitive to oxygen deprivation and will start to deteriorate within 1 or 2 minutes, and permanent damage (cell death)couldresultwithinafewhours.Thelossofbloodflowtopartofthebrainisknownasa stroke,oracerebrovascular accident (CVA).
There are two main types of stroke, depending on how the blood supply is compromised: ischemic and hemorrhagic.
Anischemicstroke isthelossofbloodflowtoanareabecausevesselsareblockedornarrowed.Thisisoftencausedbyan embolus, which may be a blood clot or fat deposit.
Ischemia may also be the result of thickening of the blood vessel wall, or a drop in blood volume in the brain known as hypovolemia.
A related type of CVA is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is similar to a stroke although it does not last as long.
The diagnostic definition of a stroke includes effects that last at least 24 hours.
Any stroke symptoms that are resolved within a 24-hour period because of restoration of adequate blood flow are classified as a TIA.
Ahemorrhagicstroke isbleedingintothebrainbecauseofadamagedbloodvessel.Accumulatedbloodfillsaregion of the cranial vault and presses against the tissue in the brain (Figure 16.3).
Physical pressure on the brain can cause the loss of function, as well as the squeezing of local arteries resulting in compromised blood flow beyond the site of the hemorrhage.
As blood pools in the nervous tissue and the vasculature is damaged, the blood-brain barrier can break down and allow additional fluid to accumulate in the region, which is known as edema.
Figure 16.3 Hemorrhagic Stroke (a) A hemorrhage into the tissue of the cerebrum results in a large accumulation of blood (bottom arrow) with an additional edema in the adjacent tissue (top arrow).
The hemorrhagic area causes the entire brain to be disfigured as suggested here by the lateral ventricles being squeezed into the opposite hemisphere.

Blunt force trauma, such as from a motor vehicle accident, can physically damage the CNS.
A class of disorders that affect the nervous system are the neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôsdisease,Huntington‚Äôsdisease,amyotrophiclateralsclerosis(ALS),Creutzfeld‚ÄìJacobdisease,multiplesclerosis (MS), and other disorders that are the result of nervous tissue degeneration.
In diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, or ALS,neuronsdie;indiseaseslikeMS,myelinisaffected.Someofthesedisordersaffectmotorfunction,andotherspresent with dementia.
How patients with these disorders perform in the neurological exam varies, but is often broad in its effects, such as memory deficits that compromise many aspects of the mental status exam, or movement deficits that compromise aspects of the cranial nerve exam, the motor exam, or the coordination exam.
The causes of these disorders are also varied.
Some are the result of genetics, such as Huntington‚Äôs disease, or the result of autoimmunity, such as MS; others are not entirely understood, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs diseases.
Current research suggests that many of these diseases are related in how the degeneration takes place and may be treated by common therapies.
Finally, a common cause of neurological changes is observed in developmental disorders.
Whether the result of genetic factors or the environment during development, there are certain situations that result in neurological functions being different from the expected norms.
Developmental disorders are difficult to define because they are caused by defects that existed in the past and disrupted the normal development of the CNS.
These defects probably involve multiple environmental and genetic factors‚Äîmost of the time, we don‚Äôt know what the cause is other than that it is more complex than just one factor.
Furthermore, each defect on its own may not be a problem, but when several are added together, they candisruptgrowthprocessesthatarenotwellunderstandinthefirstplace.Forinstance,itispossibleforastroketodamage a specific region of the brain and lead to the loss of the ability to recognize faces (prosopagnosia).
The link between cell death in the fusiform gyrus and the symptom is relatively easy to understand.

However, these children do not lack a fusiform gyrus,noristhereanydamageordefectvisibletothisbrainregion.Weconclude,ratherpoorly,thatthisbrainregionisnot connected properly to other brain regions.
Infection,trauma,andcongenitaldisorderscanallleadtosignificantsigns,asidentifiedthroughtheneurologicalexam.
It is important to differentiate between an acute event, such as stroke, and a chronic or global condition such as blunt force trauma.
Responses seen in the neurological exam can help.
A loss of language function observed in all its aspects is more likely a global event as opposed to a discrete loss of one function, such as not being able to say certain types of words.
A concern, however, is that a specific function‚Äîsuch as controlling the muscles of speech‚Äîmay mask other language functions.
The various subtests within the mental status exam can address these finer points and help clarify the underlying cause of the neurological loss.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neuroexam2) for an introduction to the neurological exam.
Studying the neurological exam can give insight into how structure and function in the nervous system are interdependent.
This is a tool both in the clinic and in the classroom, but for different reasons.

Though medical technology provides noninvasive imaging and real-time functional data, the presenter says these cannot replace the history at the core of the medical examination.
What does history mean in the context of medical practice?CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 651 16.2|The Mental Status Exam By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the relationship of mental status exam results to cerebral functions ‚Ä¢Explain the categorization of regions of the cortex based on anatomy and physiology ‚Ä¢Differentiate between primary, association, and integration areas of the cerebral cortex ‚Ä¢Provide examples of localization of function related to the cerebral cortex Intheclinicalsetting,thesetofsubtestsknownasthementalstatusexamhelpsusunderstandtherelationshipofthebrainto thebody.Ultimately,thisisaccomplishedbyassessingbehavior.Tremorsrelatedtointentionalmovements,incoordination, or the neglect of one side of the body can be indicative of failures of the connections of the cerebrum either within the hemispheres, or from the cerebrum to other portions of the nervous system.
There is no strict test for what the cerebrum does alone, but rather in what it does through its control of the rest of the CNS, the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the musculature.
Sometimes eliciting a behavior is as simple as asking a question.
Asking a patient to state his or her name is not only to verify that the file folder in a health care provider‚Äôs hands is the correct one, but also to be sure that the patient is aware, oriented,andcapableofinteractingwithanotherperson.Iftheanswerto‚ÄúWhatisyourname?‚Äùis‚ÄúSantaClaus,‚Äùtheperson may have a problem understanding reality.
If the person just stares at the examiner with a confused look on their face, the person may have a problem understanding or producing speech.
Functions of the Cerebral Cortex The cerebrum is the seat of many of the higher mental functions, such as memory and learning, language, and conscious perception, which are the subjects of subtests of the mental status exam.
The cerebral cortex is the thin layer of gray matter on the outside of the cerebrum.
It is approximately a millimeter thick in most regions and highly folded to fit within the limited space of the cranial vault.
These higher functions are distributed across various regions of the cortex, and specific locations can be said to be responsible for particular functions.
There is a limited set of regions, for example, that are involved in language function, and they can be subdivided on the basis of the particular part of language function that each governs.
The basis for parceling out areas of the cortex and attributing them to various functions has its root in pure anatomical underpinnings.
The German neurologist and histologist Korbinian Brodmann, who made a careful study of the cytoarchitecture of the cerebrum around the turn of the nineteenth century, described approximately 50 regions of the cortex that differed enough from each other to be considered separate areas (Figure 16.4 ).
Brodmann made preparations of many different regions of the cerebral cortex to view with a microscope.
He compared the size, shape, and number of neurons to find anatomical differences in the various parts of the cerebral cortex.
Continued investigation into these anatomicalareasoverthesubsequent100ormoreyearshasdemonstratedastrongcorrelationbetweenthestructuresandthe functions attributed to those structures.
For example, the first three areas in Brodmann‚Äôs list‚Äîwhich are in the postcentral gyrus‚Äîcompose the primary somatosensory cortex.
Within this area, finer separation can be made on the basis of the conceptofthesensoryhomunculus,aswellasthedifferentsubmodalitiesofsomatosensationsuchastouch,vibration,pain, temperature, or proprioception.
Today, we more frequently refer to these regions by their function (i.e., primary sensory cortex) than by the number Brodmann assigned to them, but in some situations the use of Brodmann numbers persists.652 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 16.4 Brodmann's Areas of the Cerebral Cortex On the basis of cytoarchitecture, the anatomist Korbinian Brodmann described the extensive array of cortical regions, as illustrated in his figure.
Subsequent investigations found that these areas corresponded very well to functional differences in the cerebral cortex.
(credit: modification of work by ‚ÄúLooie496‚Äù/Wikimedia Commons, based on original work by Korvinian Brodmann) Area 17, as Brodmann described it, is also known as the primary visual cortex.
Adjacent to that are areas 18 and 19, which constitute subsequent regions of visual processing.
Area 22 is the primary auditory cortex, and it is followed by area 23, which further processes auditory information.
Area 4 is the primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus, whereas area 6 is the premotor cortex.
These areas suggest some specialization within the cortex for functional processing, both in sensory and motor regions.
The fact that Brodmann‚Äôs areas correlate so closely to functional localization in the cerebral cortex demonstrates the strong link between structure and function in these regions.
Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, and 22 are each described as primary cortical areas.
The adjoining regions are each referred to as association areas.
Primary areas are where sensory information is initially received from the thalamus for conscious perception, or‚Äîin the case of the primary motor cortex‚Äîwhere descending commands are sent down to the brain stem or spinal cord to execute movements ( Figure 16.5 ).
Figure 16.5 Types of Cortical Areas The cerebral cortex can be described as containing three types of processing regions: primary, association, and integration areas.
The primary cortical areas are where sensory information is initially processed, or where motor commands emerge to go to the brain stem or spinal cord.
Association areas are adjacent to primary areas and further process the modality-specific input.
Multimodal integration areas are found where the modality-specific regions meet; they can process multiple modalities together or different modalities on the basis of similar functions, such as spatial processing in vision or somatosensation.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 653 A number of other regions, which extend beyond these primary or association areas of the cortex, are referred to as integrative areas.
These areas are found in the spaces between the domains for particular sensory or motor functions, and they integrate multisensory information, or process sensory or motor information in more complex ways.
Consider, for example, the posterior parietal cortex that lies between the somatosensory cortex and visual cortex regions.
This has been ascribedtothecoordinationofvisualandmotorfunctions,suchasreachingtopickupaglass.Thesomatosensoryfunction that would be part of this is the proprioceptive feedback from moving the arm and hand.
The weight of the glass, based on what it contains, will influence how those movements are executed.
Cognitive Abilities Assessment of cerebral functions is directed at cognitive abilities.
The abilities assessed through the mental status exam can be separated into four groups: orientation and memory, language and speech, sensorium, and judgment and abstract reasoning.
Orientation and Memory Orientation is the patient‚Äôs awareness of his or her immediate circumstances.
It is awareness of time, not in terms of the clock, but of the date and what is occurring around the patient.
It is awareness of place, such that a patient should know whereheorsheisandwhy.Itisalsoawarenessofwhothepatientis‚Äîrecognizingpersonalidentityandbeingabletorelate that to the examiner.
The initial tests of orientation are based on the questions, ‚ÄúDo you know what the date is?‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo youknowwhereyouare?‚Äùor‚ÄúWhatisyourname?‚ÄùFurtherunderstandingofapatient‚Äôsawarenessoforientationcancome fromquestionsthataddressremotememory,suchas‚ÄúWhoisthePresidentoftheUnitedStates?‚Äù,oraskingwhathappened on a specific date.
There are also specific tasks to address memory.
One is the three-word recall test.
The patient is given three words to recall,suchasbook,clock,andshovel.Afterashortinterval,duringwhichotherpartsoftheinterviewcontinue,thepatient isaskedtorecallthethreewords.Othertasksthatassessmemory‚Äîasidefromthoserelatedtoorientation‚Äîhavethepatient recite the months of the year in reverse order to avoid the overlearned sequence and focus on the memory of the months in an order, or to spell common words backwards, or to recite a list of numbers back.
Memory is largely a function of the temporal lobe, along with structures beneath the cerebral cortex such as the hippocampus and the amygdala.
The storage of memory requires these structures of the medial temporal lobe.
A famous case of a man who had both medial temporal lobes removed to treat intractable epilepsy provided insight into the relationship between the structures of the brain and the function of memory .
Henry Molaison, who was referred to as patient HM when he was alive, had epilepsy localized to both of his medial temporal lobes.
In 1953, a bilateral lobectomy was performed that alleviated the epilepsy but resulted in the inability for HM to form new memories‚Äîa condition called anterograde amnesia .
HM was able to recall most events from before his surgery, although there was a partial loss of earlier memories, which is referred to as retrograde amnesia.
HM became the subjectofextensivestudiesintohowmemoryworks.Whathewasunabletodowasformnewmemoriesofwhathappened tohim,whatarenowcalled episodicmemory .Episodicmemoryisautobiographicalinnature,suchasrememberingriding abicycleasachildaroundtheneighborhood,asopposedtothe proceduralmemory ofhowtorideabike.HMalsoretained hisshort-termmemory,suchaswhatistestedbythethree-wordtaskdescribedabove.Afterabriefperiod,thosememories would dissipate or decay and not be stored in the long-term because the medial temporal lobe structures were removed.
The difference in short-term, procedural, and episodic memory, as evidenced by patient HM, suggests that there are different parts of the brain responsible for those functions.
The long-term storage of episodic memory requires the hippocampus and related medial temporal structures, and the location of those memories is in the multimodal integration areas of the cerebral cortex.
However, short-term memory‚Äîalso called working or active memory‚Äîis localized to the prefrontal lobe.
Because patient HM had only lost his medial temporal lobe‚Äîand lost very little of his previous memories, and did not lose the ability to form new short-term memories‚Äîit was concluded that the function of the hippocampus, and adjacent structures in the medial temporal lobe, is to move (or consolidate) short-term memories (in the pre-frontal lobe) to long-term memory (in the temporal lobe).

At the hospital, a neurologist administers the mental status exam, which is mostly normal except for the three-word recall test.
The young man could not recall them even 30 seconds after hearing them and repeating them back to the doctor.

The patient eventually regained his ability to remember, though the events in the hospital were always elusive.
Considering that the effects on memory were temporary, but resulted in the loss of the specific events of the hospital stay, what regions of the brain were likely to have been affected by the antibodies and what type of memory does that represent?
Language and Speech Language is, arguably, a very human aspect of neurological function.
There are certainly strides being made in understandingcommunicationinotherspecies,butmuchofwhatmakesthehumanexperienceseeminglyuniqueisitsbasis inlanguage.Anyunderstandingofourspeciesisnecessarilyreflective,assuggestedbythequestion‚ÄúWhatamI?‚ÄùAndthe fundamental answer to this question is suggested by the famous quote by Ren√© Descartes: ‚ÄúCogito Ergo Sum‚Äù (translated from Latin as ‚ÄúI think, therefore I am‚Äù).
Formulating an understanding of yourself is largely describing who you are to yourself.
It is a confusing topic to delve into, but language is certainly at the core of what it means to be self-aware.
The neurological exam has two specific subtests that address language.
One measures the ability of the patient to understand language by asking them to follow a set of instructions to perform an action, such as ‚Äútouch your right finger to your left elbow and then to your right knee.‚Äù Another subtest assesses the fluency and coherency of language by having thepatientgeneratedescriptionsofobjectsorscenesdepictedindrawings,andbyrecitingsentencesorexplainingawritten passage.Language,however,isimportantinsomanywaysintheneurologicalexam.Thepatientneedstoknowwhattodo, whether it is as simple as explaining how the knee-jerk reflex is going to be performed, or asking a question such as ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù Often, language deficits can be determined without specific subtests; if a person cannot reply to a question properly, there may be a problem with the reception of language.
An important example of multimodal integrative areas is associated with language function (Figure 16.6).
Adjacent to the auditory association cortex, at the end of the lateral sulcus just anterior to the visual cortex, is Wernicke‚Äôs area.
In the lateral aspect of the frontal lobe, just anterior to the region of the motor cortex associated with the head and neck, is Broca‚Äôsarea.Bothregionswereoriginallydescribedonthebasisoflossesofspeechandlanguage,whichiscalled aphasia.
The aphasia associated with Broca‚Äôs area is known as an expressive aphasia, which means that speech production is compromised.
This type of aphasia is often described as non-fluency because the ability to say some words leads to broken orhaltingspeech.Grammarcanalsoappeartobelost.TheaphasiaassociatedwithWernicke‚Äôsareaisknownasa receptive aphasia, which is not a loss of speech production, but a loss of understanding of content.
Patients, after recovering from acuteformsofthisaphasia,reportnotbeingabletounderstandwhatissaidtothemorwhattheyaresayingthemselves,but they often cannot keep from talking.
Thetworegionsareconnectedbywhitemattertractsthatrunbetweentheposteriortemporallobeandthelateralaspect of the frontal lobe.
Conduction aphasia associated with damage to this connection refers to the problem of connecting the understanding of language to the production of speech.
This is a very rare condition, but is likely to present as an inability to faithfully repeat spoken language.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 655 Figure 16.6 Broca's and Wernicke's Areas Two important integration areas of the cerebral cortex associated with language function are Broca‚Äôs and Wernicke‚Äôs areas.
The two areas are connected through the deep white matter running from the posterior temporal lobe to the frontal lobe.
Sensorium Those parts of the brain involved in the reception and interpretation of sensory stimuli are referred to collectively as the sensorium.
The cerebral cortex has several regions that are necessary for sensory perception.
From the primary cortical areas of the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and gustatory senses to the association areas that process information in these modalities, the cerebral cortex is the seat of conscious sensory perception.
In contrast, sensory information can also be processed by deeper brain regions, which we may vaguely describe as subconscious‚Äîfor instance, we are not constantly aware of the proprioceptive information that the cerebellum uses to maintain balance.
Several of the subtests can reveal activity associated with these sensory modalities, such as being able to hear a question or see a picture.
Two subtests assess specific functions of these cortical areas.
The first is praxis, a practical exercise in which the patient performs a task completely on the basis of verbal description without any demonstration from the examiner.
For example, the patient can be told to take their left hand and place it palm down on their left thigh, then flip it over so the palm is facing up, and then repeat this four times.
The examiner describes the activity without any movements on their part to suggest how the movements are to be performed.
The patient needs to understand the instructions, transform them into movements, and use sensory feedback, both visual and proprioceptive, to perform the movements correctly.
The second subtest for sensory perception is gnosis, which involves two tasks.
The first task, known as stereognosis, involves the naming of objects strictly on the basis of the somatosensory information that comes from manipulating them.
The patient keeps their eyes closed and is given a common object, such as a coin, that they have to identify.
The patient shouldbeabletoindicatetheparticulartypeofcoin,suchasadimeversusapenny,oranickelversusaquarter,onthebasis ofthesensorycuesinvolved.Forexample,thesize,thickness,orweightofthecoinmaybeanindication,ortodifferentiate thepairsofcoinssuggestedhere,thesmoothorcorrugatededgeofthecoinwillcorrespondtotheparticulardenomination.
Thesecondtask, graphesthesia,istorecognizenumbersorletterswrittenonthepalmofthehandwithadullpointer,such as a pen cap.
Praxis and gnosis are related to the conscious perception and cortical processing of sensory information.
Being able to transform verbal commands into a sequence of motor responses, or to manipulate and recognize a common object and associate it with a name for that object.
Both subtests have language components because language function is integral to these functions.
The relationship between the words that describe actions, or the nouns that represent objects, and the cerebral location of these concepts is suggested to be localized to particular cortical areas.
Certain aphasias can be characterized by a deficit of verbs or nouns, known as V impairment or N impairment, or may be classified as V‚ÄìN dissociation.
Patients have difficulty using one type of word over the other.
To describe what is happening in a photograph as part of the expressive language subtest, a patient will use active- or image-based language.
The lack of one or the other of these components of language can relate to the ability to use verbs or nouns.
Damage to the region at which the frontal and temporal lobes meet, including the region known as the insula, is associated with V impairment; damage to the middle and inferior temporal lobe is associated with N impairment.
Judgment and Abstract Reasoning Planning and producing responses requires an ability to make sense of the world around us.
Making judgments and reasoning in the abstract are necessary to produce movements as part of larger responses.
For example, when your alarm goes off, do you hit the snooze button or jump out of bed?
Is 10 extra minutes in bed worth the extra rush to get ready for656 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 yourday?Willhittingthesnoozebuttonmultipletimesleadtofeelingmorerestedorresultinapanicasyourunlate?How you mentally process these questions can affect your whole day.
The prefrontal cortex is responsible for the functions responsible for planning and making decisions.
In the mental status exam, the subtest that assesses judgment and reasoning is directed at three aspects of frontal lobe function.
First, the examiner asks questions about problem solving, such as ‚ÄúIf you see a house on fire, what would you do?‚Äù The patient is also asked to interpret common proverbs, such as ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth.‚Äù Additionally, pairs of words are compared for similarities, such as apple and orange, or lamp and cabinet.
The prefrontal cortex is composed of the regions of the frontal lobe that are not directly related to specific motor functions.Themostposteriorregionofthefrontallobe,theprecentralgyrus,istheprimarymotorcortex.Anteriortothatare the premotor cortex, Broca‚Äôs area, and the frontal eye fields, which are all related to planning certain types of movements.

To an extent, the prefrontal cortex may be related to personality.
The neurological exam does not necessarily assess personality, but it can be within the realm of neurology or psychiatry.
A clinical situation that suggests this link between the prefrontal cortex and personality comes from the story of Phineas Gage, the railroad worker from the mid-1800s who had a metal spike impale his prefrontal cortex.
There are suggestions that the steel rod led to changes in his personality.
A man who was a quiet, dependable railroad worker became a raucous, irritable drunkard.
Later anecdotal evidence from his life suggests that he was able to support himself, although he had to relocate and take on a different career as a stagecoach driver.
A psychiatric practice to deal with various disorders was the prefrontal lobotomy.
This procedure was common in the 1940s and early 1950s, until antipsychotic drugs became available.
The connections between the prefrontal cortex and other regions of the brain were severed.
The disorders associated with this procedure included some aspects of what are now referred to as personality disorders, but also included mood disorders and psychoses.
Depictions of lobotomies in popular media suggest a link between cutting the white matter of the prefrontal cortex and changes in a patient‚Äôs mood and personality, though this correlation is not well understood.
Left Brain, Right Brain Popular media often refer to right-brained and left-brained people, as if the brain were two independent halves that workdifferentlyfordifferentpeople.Thisisapopularmisinterpretationofanimportantneurologicalphenomenon.As anextrememeasuretodealwithadebilitatingcondition,thecorpuscallosummaybesectionedtoovercomeintractable epilepsy.
When the connections between the two cerebral hemispheres are cut, interesting effects can be observed.
If a person with an intact corpus callosum is asked to put their hands in their pockets and describe what is there on the basis of what their hands feel, they might say that they have keys in their right pocket and loose change in the left.
They may even be able to count the coins in their pocket and say if they can afford to buy a candy bar from the vending machine.
If a person with a sectioned corpus callosum is given the same instructions, they will do something quite peculiar.
They will only put their right hand in their pocket and say they have keys there.
They will not even move their left hand, much less report that there is loose change in the left pocket.
The reason for this is that the language functions of the cerebral cortex are localized to the left hemisphere in 95 percent of the population.
Additionally, the left hemisphere is connected to the right side of the body through the corticospinal tract and the ascending tracts of the spinal cord.
Motor commands from the precentral gyrus control the oppositesideofthebody,whereassensoryinformationprocessedbythepostcentralgyrusisreceivedfromtheopposite sideofthebody.Foraverbalcommandtoinitiatemovementoftherightarmandhand,theleftsideofthebrainneeds to be connected by the corpus callosum.
Language is processed in the left side of the brain and directly influences the left brain and right arm motor functions, but is sent to influence the right brain and left arm motor functions through thecorpuscallosum.Likewise,theleft-handedsensoryperceptionofwhatisintheleftpockettravelsacrossthecorpus callosum from the right brain, so no verbal report on those contents would be possible if the hand happened to be in the pocket.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 657 Watch the video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2brains) titled ‚ÄúThe Man With Two Brains‚Äù to see the neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga introduce a patient he has worked with for years who has had his corpus callosum cut, separating histwocerebralhemispheres.Afewtestsareruntodemonstratehowthismanifestsintestsofcerebralfunction.Unlike normal people, this patient can perform two independent tasks at the same time because the lines of communication between the right and left sides of his brain have been removed.
Whereas a person with an intact corpus callosum cannot overcome the dominance of one hemisphere over the other, this patient can.
If the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant in the majority of people, why would right-handedness be most common?
The Mental Status Exam The cerebrum, particularly the cerebral cortex, is the location of important cognitive functions that are the focus of the mental status exam.
The regionalization of the cortex, initially described on the basis of anatomical evidence of cytoarchitecture,revealsthedistributionoffunctionallydistinctareas.Corticalregionscanbedescribedasprimarysensory ormotorareas,associationareas,ormultimodalintegrationareas.Thefunctionsattributedtotheseregionsincludeattention, memory, language, speech, sensation, judgment, and abstract reasoning.
The mental status exam addresses these cognitive abilities through a series of subtests designed to elicit particular behaviors ascribed to these functions.
The loss of neurological function can illustrate the location of damage to the cerebrum.
Memory functions are attributed to the temporal lobe, particularly the medial temporal lobe structures known as the hippocampus and amygdala, along with the adjacent cortex.
Evidence of the importance of these structures comes from the side effects of a bilateral temporal lobectomy that were studied in detail in patient HM.
Losses of language and speech functions, known as aphasias, are associated with damage to the important integration areas in the left hemisphere known as Broca‚Äôs or Wernicke‚Äôs areas, as well as the connections in the white matter between them.
Different types of aphasia are named for the particular structures that are damaged.
Assessment of the functions of the sensorium includes praxis and gnosis.
The subtests related to these functions depend on multimodal integration, as well as language-dependent processing.
The prefrontal cortex contains structures important for planning, judgment, reasoning, and working memory.
Damage to these areas can result in changes to personality, mood, and behavior.
The famous case of Phineas Gage suggests a role for this cortex in personality, as does the outdated practice of prefrontal lobectomy.
16.3|The Cranial Nerve Exam By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the functional grouping of cranial nerves ‚Ä¢Match the regions of the forebrain and brain stem that are connected to each cranial nerve ‚Ä¢Suggest diagnoses that would explain certain losses of function in the cranial nerves ‚Ä¢Relate cranial nerve deficits to damage of adjacent, unrelated structures The twelve cranial nerves are typically covered in introductory anatomy courses, and memorizing their names is facilitated by numerous mnemonics developed by students over the years of this practice.

Threeofthenervesarestrictlyresponsibleforspecialsenseswhereasfourotherscontainfibersforspecialandgeneral senses.
Three nerves are connected to the extraocular muscles resulting in the control of gaze.
Four nerves connect to muscles of the face, oral cavity, and pharynx, controlling facial expressions, mastication, swallowing, and speech.
Four nerves make up the cranial component of the parasympathetic nervous system responsible for pupillary constriction, salivation, and the regulation of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.
Finally, one nerve controls the muscles of the neck, assisting with spinal control of the movement of the head and neck.658 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Thecranialnerveexamallowsdirectedtestsofforebrainandbrainstemstructures.Thetwelvecranialnervesservethe head and neck.

Thespecialsensesareservedthroughthecranialnerves,aswellasthegeneralsensesoftheheadandneck.Themovement of the eyes, face, tongue, throat, and neck are all under the control of cranial nerves.
Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers that control pupillary size, salivary glands, and the thoracic and upper abdominal viscera are found in four of the nerves.
Tests of these functions can provide insight into damage to specific regions of the brain stem and may uncover deficits in adjacent regions.

Olfaction is not the pre-eminent sense, but its loss can be quite detrimental.The enjoyment of food is largely based on our sense of smell.
Anosmia means that food will not seem to have the same taste, though the gustatory sense is intact, and food will often be described as being bland.
However, the taste of food can be improved by adding ingredients (e.g., salt) that stimulate the gustatory sense.
Testing vision relies on the tests that are common in an optometry office.
The Snellen chart (Figure 16.7) demonstrates visual acuity by presenting standard Roman letters in a variety of sizes.
The result of this test is a rough generalization of the acuity of a person based on the normal accepted acuity, such that a letter that subtends a visual angle of5minutesofanarcat20feetcanbeseen.Tohave20/60vision,forexample,meansthatthesmallestlettersthataperson canseeata20-footdistancecouldbeseenbyapersonwithnormalacuityfrom60feetaway.Testingtheextentofthevisual fieldmeansthattheexaminercanestablishtheboundariesofperipheralvisionassimplyasholdingtheirhandsouttoeither side and asking the patient when the fingers are no longer visible without moving the eyes to track them.
If it is necessary, further tests can establishthe perceptionsin the visual fields.
Physical inspectionof the opticdisk, or where the opticnerve emerges from the eye, can be accomplished by looking through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 659 Figure 16.7 The Snellen Chart The Snellen chart for visual acuity presents a limited number of Roman letters in lines of decreasing size.
The line with letters that subtend 5 minutes of an arc from 20 feet represents the smallest letters that a person with normal acuity should be able to read at that distance.
The different sizes of letters in the other lines represent rough approximations of what a person of normal acuity can read at different distances.
For example, the line that represents 20/200 vision would have larger letters so that they are legible to the person with normal acuity at 200 feet.
The optic nerves from both sides enter the cranium through the respective optic canals and meet at the optic chiasm at which fibers sort such that the two halves of the visual field are processed by the opposite sides of the brain.
Deficits in visual field perception often suggest damage along the length of the optic pathway between the orbit and the diencephalon.
Forexample,lossofperipheralvisionmaybetheresultofapituitarytumorpressingontheopticchiasm(Figure16.8).The pituitary, seated in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, is directly inferior to the optic chiasm.
The axons that decussate in the chiasm are from the medial retinae of either eye, and therefore carry information from the peripheral visual field.660 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 16.8 Pituitary Tumor The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone within the cranial floor, placing it immediately inferior to the optic chiasm.
If the pituitary gland develops a tumor, it can press against the fibers crossing in the chiasm.
Those fibers are conveying peripheral visual information to the opposite side of the brain, so the patient will experience ‚Äútunnel vision‚Äù‚Äîmeaning that only the central visual field will be perceived.
The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries both equilibrium and auditory sensations from the inner ear to the medulla.
Though the two senses are not directly related, anatomy is mirrored in the two systems.
Problems with balance, such as vertigo, and deficits in hearing may both point to problems with the inner ear.
Within the petrous region of the temporal bone is the bony labyrinth of the inner ear.
The vestibule is the portion for equilibrium, composed of the utricle, saccule,andthethreesemicircularcanals.Thecochleaisresponsiblefortransducingsoundwavesintoaneuralsignal.The sensory nerves from these two structures travel side-by-side as the vestibulocochlear nerve, though they are really separate divisions.
They both emerge from the inner ear, pass through the internal auditory meatus, and synapse in nuclei of the superior medulla.
Though they are part of distinct sensory systems, the vestibular nuclei and the cochlear nuclei are close neighborswithadjacentinputs.Deficitsinoneorbothsystemscouldoccurfromdamagethatencompassesstructuresclose to both.
Damage to structures near the two nuclei can result in deficits to one or both systems.
Balance or hearing deficits may be the result of damage to the middle or inner ear structures.
M√©ni√®re's disease is a disorder that can affect both equilibrium and audition in a variety of ways.
The patient can suffer from vertigo, a low- frequency ringing in the ears, or a loss of hearing.
From patient to patient, the exact presentation of the disease can be different.
Additionally, within a single patient, the symptoms and signs may change as the disease progresses.
Use of the neurological exam subtests for the vestibulocochlear nerve illuminates the changes a patient may go through.
The disease appears to be the result of accumulation, or over-production, of fluid in the inner ear, in either the vestibule or cochlea.
Tests of equilibrium are important for coordination and gait and are related to other aspects of the neurological exam.
Thevestibulo-ocularreflexinvolvesthecranialnervesforgazecontrol.Balanceandequilibrium,astestedbytheRomberg test, are part of spinal and cerebellar processes and involved in those components of the neurological exam, as discussed later.
Hearing is tested by using a tuning fork in a couple of different ways.
The Rinne test involves using a tuning fork to distinguish between conductive hearing andsensorineural hearing.
Conductive hearing relies on vibrations being conducted through the ossicles of the middle ear.
Sensorineural hearing is the transmission of sound stimuli through the neural components of the inner ear and cranial nerve.
A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and the patientindicateswhenthesoundproducedfromthisisnolongerpresent.Thentheforkisimmediatelymovedtojustnextto the ear canal so the sound travels through the air.
If the sound is not heard through the ear, meaning the sound is conducted betterthroughthetemporalbonethanthroughtheossicles,aconductivehearingdeficitispresent.The Webertest alsouses a tuning fork to differentiate between conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss.
In this test, the tuning fork is placed at thetopoftheskull,andthesoundofthetuningforkreachesbothinnerearsbytravellingthroughbone.Inahealthypatient, the sound would appear equally loud in both ears.
With unilateral conductive hearing loss, however, the tuning fork sounds louder in the ear with hearing loss.

Thetrigeminalsystemoftheheadandneckistheequivalentoftheascendingspinalcordsystemsofthedorsalcolumn and the spinothalamic pathways.
Somatosensation of the face is conveyed along the nerve to enter the brain stem at the level of the pons.
Synapses of those axons, however, are distributed across nuclei found throughout the brain stem.
The mesencephalic nucleus processes proprioceptive information of the face, which is the movement and position of facial muscles.
It is the sensory component of the jaw-jerk reflex, a stretch reflex of the masseter muscle.
The chief nucleus, locatedinthepons,receivesinformationaboutlighttouchaswellasproprioceptiveinformationaboutthemandible,which are both relayed to the thalamus and, ultimately, to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe.
The spinal trigeminal nucleus, located in the medulla, receives information about crude touch, pain, and temperature to be relayed to the thalamus andCHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 661 cortex.Essentially,theprojectionthroughthechiefnucleusisanalogoustothedorsalcolumnpathwayforthebody,andthe projection through the spinal trigeminal nucleus is analogous to the spinothalamic pathway .
Subtests for the sensory component of the trigeminal system are the same as those for the sensory exam targeting the spinal nerves.
The primary sensory subtest for the trigeminal system is sensory discrimination.
A cotton-tipped applicator, which is cotton attached to the end of a thin wooden stick, can be used easily for this.
The wood of the applicator can be snapped so that a pointed end is opposite the soft cotton-tipped end.
The cotton end provides a touch stimulus, while the pointed end provides a painful, or sharp, stimulus.
While the patient‚Äôs eyes are closed, the examiner touches the two ends oftheapplicatortothepatient‚Äôsface,alternatingrandomlybetweenthem.Thepatientmustidentifywhetherthestimulusis sharp or dull.
These stimuli are processed by the trigeminal system separately.

Failure to discriminate these stimuli can localize problems within the brain stem.

Damage, such as a stroke, that results in changes in sensory discrimination may indicate these unrelated regions are af fected as well.
Gaze Control The three nerves that control the extraocular muscles are the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which are the third,fourth,andsixthcranialnerves.Asthenamesuggests,theabducensnerveisresponsibleforabductingtheeye,which itcontrolsthroughcontractionofthelateralrectusmuscle.Thetrochlearnervecontrolsthesuperiorobliquemuscletorotate the eye along its axis in the orbit medially, which is called intorsion, and is a component of focusing the eyes on an object close to the face.
The oculomotor nerve controls all the other extraocular muscles, as well as a muscle of the upper eyelid.
Movements of the two eyes need to be coordinated to locate and track visual stimuli accurately.
When moving the eyes to locate an object in the horizontal plane, or to track movement horizontally in the visual field, the lateral rectus muscle of one eye and medial rectus muscle of the other eye are both active.
The lateral rectus is controlled by neurons of the abducens nucleus in the superior medulla, whereas the medial rectus is controlled by neurons in the oculomotor nucleus of the midbrain.
Coordinated movement of both eyes through different nuclei requires integrated processing through the brain stem.
In the midbrain, the superior colliculus integrates visual stimuli with motor responses to initiate eye movements.
The paramedianpontinereticularformation(PPRF) willinitiatearapideyemovement,or saccade,tobringtheeyestobear on a visual stimulus quickly.
These areas are connected to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei by the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) that runs through the majority of the brain stem.
The MLF allows for conjugate gaze, or the movement of the eyes in the same direction, during horizontal movements that require the lateral and medial rectus muscles.
Control of conjugate gaze strictly in the vertical direction is contained within the oculomotor complex.
To elevate theeyes,theoculomotornerveoneithersidestimulatesthecontractionofbothsuperiorrectusmuscles;todepresstheeyes, the oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both inferior rectus muscles.
Purely vertical movements of the eyes are not very common.
Movements are often at an angle, so some horizontal components are necessary, adding the medial and lateral rectus muscles to the movement.
The rapid movement of the eyes usedtolocateanddirectthefoveaontovisualstimuliiscalledasaccade.Noticethatthepathsthataretracedin Figure16.9 arenotstrictlyvertical.Themovementsbetweenthenoseandthemouthareclosest,butstillhaveaslanttothem.Also,the superior and inferior rectus muscles are not perfectly oriented with the line of sight.
The origin for both muscles is medial totheirinsertions,soelevationanddepressionmayrequirethelateralrectusmusclestocompensatefortheslightadduction inherent in the contraction of those muscles, requiring MLF activity as well.662 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 16.9 Saccadic Eye Movements Saccades are rapid, conjugate movements of the eyes to survey a complicated visual stimulus, or to follow a moving visual stimulus.
This image represents the shifts in gaze typical of a person studying a face.
Notice the concentration of gaze on the major features of the face and the large number of paths traced between the eyes or around the mouth.
Testing eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track the tip of a pen as it is passed through the visual field.
This may appear similar to testing visual field deficits related to the optic nerve, but the difference is that the patient is asked to not move the eyes while the examiner moves a stimulus into the peripheral visual field.
Here, the extent of movement is the point of the test.
The examiner is watching for conjugate movements representing proper function of the related nuclei and the MLF.
Failure of one eye to abduct while the other adducts in a horizontal movement is referred to asinternuclear ophthalmoplegia.
When this occurs, the patient will experience diplopia, or double vision, as the two eyes are temporarily pointed at different stimuli.
Diplopia is not restricted to failure of the lateral rectus, because any of the extraocular muscles may fail to move one eye in perfect conjugation with the other .
The final aspect of testing eye movements is to move the tip of the pen in toward the patient‚Äôs face.
As visual stimuli moveclosertotheface,thetwomedialrectimusclescausetheeyestomoveintheonenonconjugatemovementthatispart of gaze control.
When the two eyes move to look at something closer to the face, they both adduct, which is referred to as convergence .Tokeepthestimulusinfocus,theeyealsoneedstochangetheshapeofthelens,whichiscontrolledthrough theparasympatheticfibersoftheoculomotornerve.Thechangeinfocalpoweroftheeyeisreferredtoas accommodation.
Accommodation ability changes with age; focusing on nearer objects, such as the written text of a book or on a computer screen,mayrequirecorrectivelenseslaterinlife.Coordinationoftheskeletalmusclesforconvergenceandcoordinationof the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for accommodation are referred to as the accommodation‚Äìconvergence reflex.
A crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli centered on the fovea of the retina.
The vestibulo- ocular reflex (VOR) coordinates all of the components (Figure 16.10), both sensory and motor, that make this possible.
If the head rotates in one direction‚Äîfor example, to the right‚Äîthe horizontal pair of semicircular canals in the inner ear indicate the movement by increased activity on the right and decreased activity on the left.
The information is sent to the abducens nuclei and oculomotor nuclei on either side to coordinate the lateral and medial rectus muscles.
The left lateral rectus and right medial rectus muscles will contract, rotating the eyes in the opposite direction of the head, while nuclei controlling the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus muscles will be inhibited to reduce antagonism of the contracting muscles.
These actions stabilize the visual field by compensating for the head rotation with opposite rotation of the eyes in theorbits.DeficitsintheVORmayberelatedtovestibulardamage,suchasinM√©ni√®re‚Äôsdisease,orfromdorsalbrainstem damage that would affect the eye movement nuclei or their connections through the MLF.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 663 Figure 16.10 Vestibulo-ocular Reflex If the head is turned in one direction, the coordination of that movement with the fixation of the eyes on a visual stimulus involves a circuit that ties the vestibular sense with the eye movement nuclei through the MLF.
Nerves of the Face and Oral Cavity An iconic part of a doctor‚Äôs visit is the inspection of the oral cavity and pharynx, suggested by the directive to ‚Äúopen your mouth and say ‚Äòah.‚Äô‚Äù This is followed by inspection, with the aid of a tongue depressor, of the back of the mouth, or the opening of the oral cavity into the pharynx known as the fauces.
Whereas this portion of a medical exam inspects for signs of infection, such as in tonsillitis, it is also the means to test the functions of the cranial nerves that are associated with the oral cavity.
The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves convey gustatory stimulation to the brain.
Testing this is as simple as introducing salty, sour, bitter, or sweet stimuli to either side of the tongue.
The patient should respond to the taste stimulus before retracting the tongue into the mouth.
Stimuli applied to specific locations on the tongue will dissolve into the saliva and may stimulate taste buds connected to either the left or right of the nerves, masking any lateral deficits.
Along with taste, the glossopharyngeal nerve relays general sensations from the pharyngeal walls.
These sensations, along with certain taste stimuli, can stimulate the gag reflex.
If the examiner moves the tongue depressor to contact the lateral wall of the fauces, this should elicit the gag reflex.
Stimulation of either side of the fauces should elicit an equivalent response.
The motor response, through contraction of the muscles of the pharynx, is mediated through the vagus nerve.
Normally, the vagus nerve is considered autonomic in nature.
The vagus nerve directly stimulates the contraction of skeletal muscles in the pharynx and larynx to contribute to the swallowing and speech functions.
Further testing of vagus motor function has the patient repeating consonant sounds that require movement of the muscles around the fauces.
The patient is asked to say ‚Äúlah-kah-pah‚Äù or a similar set of alternating sounds while the examiner observes the movements of the soft palate and arches between the palate and tongue.
The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are also responsible for the initiation of salivation.
Neurons in the salivary nuclei of the medulla project through these two nerves as preganglionic fibers, and synapse in ganglia located in the head.
Theparasympatheticfibersofthefacialnervesynapseinthepterygopalatineganglion,whichprojectstothesubmandibular gland and sublingual gland.
The parasympathetic fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in the otic ganglion, which projects to the parotid gland.
Salivation in response to food in the oral cavity is based on a visceral reflex arc within the664 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 facial or glossopharyngeal nerves.
Other stimuli that stimulate salivation are coordinated through the hypothalamus, such as the smell and sight of food.
The hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve that controls the muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus muscle, which is controlled by the vagus nerve.
There are two sets of muscles of the tongue.
The extrinsic muscles of the tongue are connected to other structures, whereas the intrinsic muscles of the tongue are completely contained within the lingual tissues.
While examining the oral cavity, movement of the tongue will indicate whether hypoglossal function is impaired.
The test for hypoglossal function is the ‚Äústick out your tongue‚Äù part of the exam.
The genioglossus muscle is responsible forprotrusionofthetongue.Ifthehypoglossalnervesonbothsidesareworkingproperly,thenthetonguewillstickstraight out.
If the nerve on one side has a deficit, the tongue will stick out to that side‚Äîpointing to the side with damage.
Loss of function of the tongue can interfere with speech and swallowing.
Additionally, because the location of the hypoglossal nerve and nucleus is near the cardiovascular center, inspiratory and expiratory areas for respiration, and the vagus nuclei that regulate digestive functions, a tongue that protrudes incorrectly can suggest damage in adjacent structures that have nothing to do with controlling the tongue.
Watchthisshort video(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/facialnerve) toseeanexaminationofthefacialnerveusingsome simple tests.
The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression.
Severe deficits will be obvious in watching someone use those muscles for normal control.
One side of the face might not move like the other side.
But directed tests, especially for contraction against resistance, require a formal testing of the muscles.
The muscles of the upper and lower face need to be tested.
The strength test in this video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut and the examiner trying to pry her eyes open.
Why does the examiner ask her to try a second time?
Motor Nerves of the Neck The accessory nerve, also referred to as the spinal accessory nerve, innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles (Figure 16.11).
When both the sternocleidomastoids contract, the head flexes forward; individually, they cause rotation to the opposite side.
The trapezius can act as an antagonist, causing extension and hyperextension of the neck.
These two superficial muscles are important for changing the position of the head.
Both muscles also receive input from cervical spinal nerves.
Along with the spinal accessory nerve, these nerves contribute to elevating the scapula and clavicle through the trapezius, which is tested by asking the patient to shrug both shoulders, and watching for asymmetry.
For the sternocleidomastoid, those spinal nerves are primarily sensory projections, whereas the trapezius also has lateral insertions to the clavicle and scapula, and receives motor input from the spinal cord.
Calling the nerve the spinal accessory nerve suggests that it is aiding the spinal nerves.
Though that is not precisely how the name originated, it does help make the associationbetweenthefunctionofthisnerveincontrollingthesemusclesandtherolethesemusclesplayinmovementsof the trunk or shoulders.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 665 Figure16.11MusclesControlledbytheAccessoryNerve The accessory nerve innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, both of which attach to the head and to the trunk and shoulders.
They can act as antagonists in head flexion and extension, and as synergists in lateral flexion toward the shoulder .
To test these muscles, the patient is asked to flex and extend the neck or shrug the shoulders against resistance, testing the strength of the muscles.
Lateral flexion of the neck toward the shoulder tests both at the same time.
Any difference on one side versus the other would suggest damage on the weaker side.
These strength tests are common for the skeletal muscles controlled by spinal nerves and are a significant component of the motor exam.
Deficits associated with the accessory nerve may have an effect on orienting the head, as described with the VOR.
The Pupillary Light Response The autonomic control of pupillary size in response to a bright light involves the sensory input of the optic nerve and the parasympathetic motor output of the oculomotor nerve.
When light hits the retina, specialized photosensitive ganglion cells send a signal along the optic nerve to the pretectal nucleus in the superior midbrain.
A neuron from this nucleus projects to the Eddinger‚ÄìWestphal nuclei in the oculomotor complex in both sides of the midbrain.
Neurons in this nucleus give rise to the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that project through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit.
The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the ganglion project to the iris, where they release acetylcholine onto circular fibers that constrict the pupil to reduce the amount of light hitting the retina.
The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for dilating the pupil when light levels are low .
Shining light in one eye will elicit constriction of both pupils.
The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is bilateral.
Light shined in one eye causes a constriction of that pupil, as well as constriction of the contralateral pupil.
Shining a penlight in the eye of a patient is a very artificial situation, as both eyes are normally exposed to the same light sources.
Testing this reflex can illustrate whether the optic nerve or the oculomotor nerve is damaged.
If shiningthelightinoneeyeresultsinnochangesinpupillarysizebutshininglightintheoppositeeyeelicitsanormal, bilateralresponse,thedamageisassociatedwiththeopticnerveonthenonresponsiveside.Iflightineithereyeelicits a response in only one eye, the problem is with the oculomotor system.
If light in the right eye only causes the left pupil to constrict, the direct reflex is lost and the consensual reflex is intact, which means that the right oculomotor nerve (or Eddinger‚ÄìWestphal nucleus) is damaged.
Damage to the right oculomotor connections will be evident when light is shined in the left eye.
In that case, the direct reflex is intact but the consensual reflex is lost, meaning that the left pupil will constrict while the right does not.666 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The Cranial Nerve Exam The cranial nerves can be separated into four major groups associated with the subtests of the cranial nerve exam.
First are the sensory nerves, then the nerves that control eye movement, the nerves of the oral cavity and superior pharynx, and the nerve that controls movements of the neck.
Theolfactory,optic,andvestibulocochlearnervesarestrictlysensorynervesforsmell,sight,andbalanceandhearing, whereas the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves carry somatosensation of the face, and taste‚Äîseparated between the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the posterior one-third.
Special senses are tested by presenting the particular stimuli to each receptive organ.
General senses can be tested through sensory discrimination of touch versus painful stimuli.
The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves control the extraocular muscles and are connected by the medial longitudinal fasciculus to coordinate gaze.
Testing conjugate gaze is as simple as having the patient follow a visual target, like a pen tip, through the visual field ending with an approach toward the face to test convergence and accommodation.
Along with the vestibular functions of the eighth nerve, the vestibulo-ocular reflex stabilizes gaze during head movements by coordinating equilibrium sensations with the eye movement systems.
The trigeminal nerve controls the muscles of chewing, which are tested for stretch reflexes.
Motor functions of the facial nerve are usually obvious if facial expressions are compromised, but can be tested by having the patient raise their eyebrows, smile, and frown.
Movements of the tongue, soft palate, or superior pharynx can be observed directly while the patient swallows, while the gag reflex is elicited, or while the patient says repetitive consonant sounds.
The motor control of the gag reflex is largely controlled by fibers in the vagus nerve and constitutes a test of that nerve because the parasympathetic functions of that nerve are involved in visceral regulation, such as regulating the heartbeat and digestion.
Movement of the head and neck using the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles is controlled by the accessory nerve.
Flexing of the neck and strength testing of those muscles reviews the function of that nerve.
16.4|The Sensory and Motor Exams By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the arrangement of sensory and motor regions in the spinal cord ‚Ä¢Relate damage in the spinal cord to sensory or motor deficits ‚Ä¢Differentiate between upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron diseases ‚Ä¢Describe the clinical indications of common reflexes Connections between the body and the CNS occur through the spinal cord.

From the initial neural tube early in embryonic development, the spinal cord retains a tube-like structure with gray matter surrounding the small central canal and white matter on the surface in three columns.
The dorsal, or posterior, horns of the gray matter are mainly devoted to sensory functions whereas the ventral, or anterior, and lateral horns are associated with motor functions.
In the white matter, the dorsal column relays sensory information to the brain, and the anterior column is almost exclusively relaying motor commands to the ventral horn motor neurons.
The lateral column, however, conveys both sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and brain.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 667 Figure 16.12 Locations of Spinal Fiber Tracts Sensory Modalities and Location Thegeneralsensesaredistributedthroughoutthebody,relyingonnervoustissueincorporatedintovariousorgans.Somatic senses are incorporated mostly into the skin, muscles, or tendons, whereas the visceral senses come from nervous tissue incorporated into the majority of organs such as the heart or stomach.
The somatic senses are those that usually make up the conscious perception of the how the body interacts with the environment.
The visceral senses are most often below the limit of conscious perception because they are involved in homeostatic regulation through the autonomic nervous system.
The sensory exam tests the somatic senses, meaning those that are consciously perceived.
Testing of the senses begins with examining the regions known as dermatomes that connect to the cortical region where somatosensation is perceived in the postcentral gyrus.
To test the sensory fields, a simple stimulus of the light touch of the soft end of a cotton-tipped applicatorisappliedatvariouslocationsontheskin.Thespinalnerves,whichcontainsensoryfiberswithdendriticendings in the skin, connect with the skin in a topographically organized manner, illustrated as dermatomes ( Figure 16.13 ).
For example, the fibers of eighth cervical nerve innervate the medial surface of the forearm and extend out to the fingers.
In addition to testing perception at different positions on the skin, it is necessary to test sensory perception within the dermatome from distal to proximal locations in the appendages, or lateral to medial locations in the trunk.
In testing the eighth cervical nerve, the patient would be asked if the touch of the cotton to the fingers or the medial forearm was perceptible, and whether there were any differences in the sensations.668 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 16.13 Dermatomes The surface of the skin can be divided into topographic regions that relate to the location of sensory endings in the skin based on the spinal nerve that contains those fibers.
(credit: modification of work by Mikael H√§ggstr√∂m) Other modalities of somatosensation can be tested using a few simple tools.
The perception of pain can be tested using the broken end of the cotton-tipped applicator.
The perception of vibratory stimuli can be testing using an oscillating tuning fork placed against prominent bone features such as the distal head of the ulna on the medial aspect of the elbow.
When the tuning fork is still, the metal against the skin can be perceived as a cold stimulus.
Using the cotton tip of the applicator, or even just a fingertip, the perception of tactile movement can be assessed as the stimulus is drawn across the skin for approximately 2‚Äì3 cm.
The patient would be asked in what direction the stimulus is moving.
All of these tests are repeated in distal and proximal locations and for different dermatomes to assess the spatial specificity of perception.
The senseofpositionandmotion,proprioception,istestedbymovingthefingersortoesandaskingthepatientiftheysensethe movement.
If the distal locations are not perceived, the test is repeated at increasingly proximal joints.
The various stimuli used to test sensory input assess the function of the major ascending tracts of the spinal cord.
The dorsal column pathway conveys fine touch, vibration, and proprioceptive information, whereas the spinothalamic pathwayprimarilyconveyspainandtemperature.Testingthesestimuliprovidesinformationaboutwhetherthesetwomajor ascending pathways are functioning properly.
Within the spinal cord, the two systems are segregated.
The dorsal column information ascends ipsilateral to the source of the stimulus and decussates in the medulla, whereas the spinothalamic pathway decussates at the level of entry and ascends contralaterally.
The differing sensory stimuli are segregated in the spinalcordsothatthevarioussubtestsforthesestimulicandistinguishwhichascendingpathwaymaybedamagedincertain situations.CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 669 Whereasthebasicsensorystimuliareassessedinthesubtestsdirectedateachsubmodalityofsomatosensation,testing the ability to discriminate sensations is important.
Pairing the light touch and pain subtests together makes it possible to compare the two submodalities at the same time, and therefore the two major ascending tracts at the same time.
Mistaking painful stimuli for light touch, or vice versa, may point to errors in ascending projections, such as in a hemisection of the spinal cord that might come from a motor vehicle accident.
Another issue of sensory discrimination is not distinguishing between different submodalities, but rather location.
The two-point discrimination subtest highlights the density of sensory endings, and therefore receptive fields in the skin.
The sensitivity to fine touch, which can give indications of the texture and detailed shape of objects, is highest in the fingertips.
To assess the limit of this sensitivity, two-point discrimination is measured by simultaneously touching the skin in two locations, such as could be accomplished with a pair of forceps.
Specialized calipers for precisely measuring the distance betweenpointsarealsoavailable.Thepatientisaskedtoindicatewhetheroneortwostimuliarepresentwhilekeepingtheir eyes closed.
The examiner will switch between using the two points and a single point as the stimulus.
Failure to recognize two points may be an indication of a dorsal column pathway deficit.
Similar to two-point discrimination, but assessing laterality of perception, is double simultaneous stimulation.
Two stimuli, such as the cotton tips of two applicators, are touched to the same position on both sides of the body.
If one side is not perceived, this may indicate damage to the contralateral posterior parietal lobe.
Because there is one of each pathway on either side of the spinal cord, they are not likely to interact.
If none of the other subtests suggest particular deficits with the pathways, the deficit is likely to be in the cortex where conscious perception is based.
The mental status exam contains subteststhatassessotherfunctionsthatareprimarilylocalizedtotheparietalcortex,suchasstereognosisandgraphesthesia.
A final subtest of sensory perception that concentrates on the sense of proprioception is known as the Romberg test.
The patient is asked to stand straight with feet together.
Once the patient has achieved their balance in that position, they are asked to close their eyes.
Without visual feedback that the body is in a vertical orientation relative to the surrounding environment,thepatientmustrelyontheproprioceptivestimuliofjointandmuscleposition,aswellasinformationfromthe inner ear, to maintain balance.
This test can indicate deficits in dorsal column pathway proprioception, as well as problems with proprioceptive projections to the cerebellum through the spinocerebellar tract .

The patient keeps their eyes closed while the examiner switches between using both points of the caliper or just one.
The patient then must indicate whether one or two stimuli are in contact with the skin.
Why is the distance between the caliper points closer on the fingertips as opposed to the palm of the hand?
And what do you think the distance would be on the arm, or the shoulder?
Muscle Strength and Voluntary Movement The skeletomotor system is largely based on the simple, two-cell projection from the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe to the skeletal muscles.
The corticospinal tract represents the neurons that send output from the primary motor cortex.
These fibers travel through the deep white matter of the cerebrum, then through the midbrain and pons, into the medulla where mostofthemdecussate,andfinallythroughthespinalcordwhitematterinthelateral(crossedfibers)oranterior(uncrossed fibers) columns.
These fibers synapse on motor neurons in the ventral horn.
The ventral horn motor neurons then project to skeletal muscle and cause contraction.
These two cells are termed the upper motor neuron (UMN) and the lower motor neuron (LMN).
Voluntary movements require these two cells to be active.
The motor exam tests the function of these neurons and the muscles they control.
First, the muscles are inspected and palpated for signs of structural irregularities.
Movement disorders may be the result of changes to the muscle tissue, such as scarring, and these possibilities need to be ruled out before testing function.
Along with this inspection, muscle tone is assessed by moving the muscles through a passive range of motion.
The arm is moved at the elbow and wrist, and the leg is moved at the knee and ankle.
Skeletal muscle should have a resting tension representing a slight contraction of the fibers.
The lack of muscle tone, known as hypotonicity orflaccidity , may indicate that the LMN is not conducting action potentials that will keep a basal level of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.670 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 If muscle tone is present, muscle strength is tested by having the patient contract muscles against resistance.
The examiner will ask the patient to lift the arm, for example, while the examiner is pushing down on it.
This is done for both limbs, including shrugging the shoulders.
Lateral differences in strength‚Äîbeing able to push against resistance with the right arm but not the left‚Äîwould indicate a deficit in one corticospinal tract versus the other.
An overall loss of strength, without laterality, could indicate a global problem with the motor system.

Reflexes Reflexes combine the spinal sensory and motor components with a sensory input that directly generates a motor response.
The reflexes that are tested in the neurological exam are classified into two groups.
A deep tendon reflex is commonly known as a stretch reflex, and is elicited by a strong tap to a tendon, such as in the knee-jerk reflex.
A superficial reflex is elicited through gentle stimulation of the skin and causes contraction of the associated muscles.
Forthearm,thecommonreflexestotestareofthebiceps,brachioradialis,triceps,andflexorsforthedigits.Fortheleg, the knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex for the gastrocnemius and soleus.

The most common superficial reflex in the neurological exam is the plantar reflex that tests for the Babinski sign on the basis of the extension or flexion of the toes at the plantar surface of the foot.
The plantar reflex is commonly tested in newborn infants to establish the presence of neuromuscular function.
To elicit this reflex, an examiner brushes a stimulus, usually the examiner‚Äôs fingertip, along the plantar surface of the infant‚Äôs foot.
An infant would present a positive Babinski sign, meaning the foot dorsiflexes and the toes extend and splay out.
As a person learns to walk, the plantar reflex changes tocausecurlingofthetoesandamoderateplantarflexion.Ifsuperficialstimulationofthesoleofthefootcausedextension of the foot, keeping one‚Äôs balance would be harder.
The descending input of the corticospinal tract modifies the response of the plantar reflex, meaning that a negative Babinski sign is the expected response in testing the reflex.
Other superficial reflexes are not commonly tested, though a series of abdominal reflexes can target function in the lower thoracic spinal segments.
Watchthis video(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/reflextest) toseehowtotestreflexesintheabdomen.Testingreflexes of the trunk is not commonly performed in the neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem with the thoracic segments of the spinal cord, a series of superficial reflexes of the abdomen can localize function to those segments.
If contraction is not observed when the skin lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is stimulated, what level of the spinal cord may be damaged?
Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage Many of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that will address whether damage to the motor system is in the upper or lower motor neurons.
Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness, strong deep tendon reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness, pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign, spasticity, and the clasp- kniferesponse.Spasticityisanexcesscontractioninresistancetostretch.Itcanresultin hyperflexia,whichiswhenjoints are overly flexed.
The clasp-knife response occurs when the patient initially resists movement, but then releases, and the joint will quickly flex like a pocket knife closing.
A lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial loss of voluntary muscle control, which is known as paresis.
The paralysis observed in LMN diseases is referred to as flaccid paralysis, referring to a complete or partial lossCHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 671 of muscle tone, in contrast to the loss of control in UMN lesions in which tone is retained and spasticity is exhibited.
Other signs of an LMN lesion are fibrillation ,fasciculation, and compromised or lost reflexes resulting from the denervation of the muscle fibers.
Spinal Cord In certain situations, such as a motorcycle accident, only half of the spinal cord may be damaged in what is known as a hemisection.
Forceful trauma to the trunk may cause ribs or vertebrae to fracture, and debris can crush or section through part of the spinal cord.
The full section of a spinal cord would result in paraplegia, or loss of voluntary motor controlofthelowerbody,aswellaslossofsensationsfromthatpointdown.Ahemisection,however,willleavespinal cord tracts intact on one side.
The resulting condition would be hemiplegia on the side of the trauma‚Äîone leg would be paralyzed.
The sensory results are more complicated.
The ascending tracts in the spinal cord are segregated between the dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways.
Thismeansthatthesensorydeficitswillbebasedontheparticularsensoryinformationeachpathwayconveys.Sensory discrimination between touch and painful stimuli will illustrate the difference in how these pathways divide these functions.
On the paralyzed leg, a patient will acknowledge painful stimuli, but not fine touch or proprioceptive sensations.
On the functional leg, the opposite is true.
The reason for this is that the dorsal column pathway ascends ipsilateral to the sensation, so it would be damaged the same way as the lateral corticospinal tract.
The spinothalamic pathway decussatesimmediatelyuponenteringthespinalcordandascendscontralateraltothesource;itwouldthereforebypass the hemisection.
Themotorsystemcanindicatethelossofinputtotheventralhorninthelumbarenlargementwheremotorneurons to the leg are found, but motor function in the trunk is less clear.

The likelihood of trauma to the spinal cord resulting in a hemisection that affects one anteriorcolumn,butnottheother,isveryunlikely.Eithertheaxialmusculaturewillnotbeaffectedatall,ortherewill be bilateral losses in the trunk.
Sensory discrimination can pinpoint the level of damage in the spinal cord.
Below the hemisection, pain stimuli will be perceived in the damaged side, but not fine touch.
The opposite is true on the other side.
The pain fibers on the side with motor function cross the midline in the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral lateral column as far as the hemisection.
The dorsal column will be intact ipsilateral to the source on the intact side and reach the brain for consciousperception.Thetraumawouldbeattheleveljustbeforesensorydiscriminationreturnstonormal,helpingto pinpoint the trauma.

16.5|The Coordination and Gait Exams By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Explain the relationship between the location of the cerebellum and its function in movement ‚Ä¢Chart the major divisions of the cerebellum ‚Ä¢List the major connections of the cerebellum ‚Ä¢Describe the relationship of the cerebellum to axial and appendicular musculature ‚Ä¢Explain the prevalent causes of cerebellar ataxia The role of the cerebellum is a subject of debate.
There is an obvious connection to motor function based on the clinical implications of cerebellar damage.
There is also strong evidence of the cerebellar role in procedural memory.
The two are notincompatible;infact,proceduralmemoryismotormemory,suchaslearningtorideabicycle.Significantworkhasbeen performed to describe the connections within the cerebellum that result in learning.
A model for this learning is classical conditioning, as shown by the famous dogs from the physiologist Ivan Pavlov‚Äôs work.
This classical conditioning, which can be related to motor learning, fits with the neural connections of the cerebellum.
The cerebellum is 10 percent of the mass of the brain and has varied functions that all point to a role in the motor system.672 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Location and Connections of the Cerebellum The cerebellum is located in apposition to the dorsal surface of the brain stem, centered on the pons.
The name of the pons is derived from its connection to the cerebellum.
The word means ‚Äúbridge‚Äù and refers to the thick bundle of myelinated axons that form a bulge on its ventral surface.
Those fibers are axons that project from the gray matter of the pons into the contralateral cerebellar cortex.
These fibers make up the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) and are the major physical connection of the cerebellum to the brain stem (Figure 16.14).
Two other white matter bundles connect the cerebellum to the other regions of the brain stem.
The superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) is the connection of the cerebellum to the midbrain and forebrain.
The inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) is the connection to the medulla.
Figure 16.14 Cerebellar Penduncles The connections to the cerebellum are the three cerebellar peduncles, which are close to each other.
The ICP arises from the medulla‚Äîspecifically from the inferior olive, which is visible as a bulge on the ventral surface of the brain stem.
The MCP is the ventral surface of the pons.
The SCP projects into the midbrain.
These connections can also be broadly described by their functions.
The ICP conveys sensory input to the cerebellum, partially from the spinocerebellar tract, but also through fibers of the inferior olive .
The MCP is part of the cortico-ponto- cerebellarpathway thatconnectsthecerebralcortexwiththecerebellumandpreferentiallytargetsthelateralregionsofthe cerebellum.Itincludesacopyofthemotorcommandssentfromtheprecentralgyrusthroughthecorticospinaltract,arising from collateral branches that synapse in the gray matter of the pons, along with input from other regions such as the visual cortex.
The SCP is the major output of the cerebellum, divided between the red nucleus in the midbrain and the thalamus, which will return cerebellar processing to the motor cortex.
These connections describe a circuit that compares motor commands and sensory feedback to generate a new output.
These comparisons make it possible to coordinate movements.
If the cerebral cortex sends a motor command to initiate walking, that command is copied by the pons and sent into the cerebellum through the MCP.
Sensory feedback in the form of proprioception from the spinal cord, as well as vestibular sensations from the inner ear, enters through the ICP.
If you take a step and begin to slip on the floor because it is wet, the output from the cerebellum‚Äîthrough the SCP‚Äîcan correct for that and keep you balanced and moving.
The red nucleus sends new motor commands to the spinal cord through the rubrospinal tract.
The cerebellum is divided into regions that are based on the particular functions and connections involved.
The midline regions of the cerebellum, the vermisandflocculonodular lobe, are involved in comparing visual information, equilibrium, and proprioceptive feedback to maintain balance and coordinate movements such as walking, or gait, through the descending output of the red nucleus (Figure 16.15).
The lateral hemispheres are primarily concerned with planning motor functions through frontal lobe inputs that are returned through the thalamic projections back to the premotor and motor cortices.
Processing in the midline regions targets movements of the axial musculature, whereas the lateral regions target movements of the appendicular musculature.
The vermis is referred to as the spinocerebellum because it primarily receives input from the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar pathways.
The flocculonodular lobe is referred to as the vestibulocerebellum becauseofthevestibularprojectionintothatregion.Finally,thelateralcerebellumisreferredtoasthe cerebrocerebellum, reflecting the significant input from the cerebral cortex through the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway .CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 673 Figure 16.15 Major Regions of the Cerebellum The cerebellum can be divided into two basic regions: the midline and the hemispheres.
The midline is composed of the vermis and the flocculonodular lobe, and the hemispheres are the lateral regions.
Coordination and Alternating Movement Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam.
The subtests target appendicular musculature, controlling the limbs, and axial musculature for posture and gait.
The assessment of cerebellar function will depend on the normal functioning of other systems addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam.
Motor control from the cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic, visual, and vestibular senses, are important to cerebellar function.
The subtests that address appendicular musculature, and therefore the lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with a check for tremor.
The patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the position.
The examiner watches for the presence of tremors that would not be present if the muscles are relaxed.
By pushing down on the arms in this position, the examiner can check for the rebound response, which is when the arms are automatically brought back to the extended position.
The extension of the arms is an ongoing motor process, and the tap or push on the arms presents a change in the proprioceptive feedback.
The cerebellum compares the cerebral motor command with the proprioceptive feedback and adjuststhedescendinginputtocorrect.TherednucleuswouldsendanadditionalsignaltotheLMNforthearmtoincrease contraction momentarily to overcome the change and regain the original position.
Thecheck reflex depends on cerebellar input to keep increased contraction from continuing after the removal of resistance.
The patient flexes the elbow against resistance from the examiner to extend the elbow.
When the examiner releases the arm, the patient should be able to stop the increased contraction and keep the arm from moving.
A similar response would be seen if you try to pick up a coffee mug that you believe to be full but turns out to be empty.
Without checking the contraction, the mug would be thrown from the overexertion of the muscles expecting to lift a heavier object.
Severalsubtestsofthecerebellumassesstheabilitytoalternatemovements,orswitchbetweenmusclegroupsthatmay be antagonistic to each other.
In the finger-to-nose test, the patient touches their finger to the examiner‚Äôs finger and then to their nose, and then back to the examiner‚Äôs finger, and back to the nose.
The examiner moves the target finger to assess a range of movements.
A similar test for the lower extremities has the patient touch their toe to a moving target, such as the examiner‚Äôs finger.
Both of these tests involve flexion and extension around a joint‚Äîthe elbow or the knee and the shoulder orhip‚Äîaswellasmovementsofthewristandankle.Thepatientmustswitchbetweentheopposingmuscles,likethebiceps and triceps brachii, to move their finger from the target to their nose.
Coordinating these movements involves the motor cortex communicating with the cerebellum through the pons and feedback through the thalamus to plan the movements.
Visual cortex information is also part of the processing that occurs in the cerebrocerebellum while it is involved in guiding movements of the finger or toe.
Rapid, alternating movements are tested for the upper and lower extremities.
The patient is asked to touch each finger to their thumb, or to pat the palm of one hand on the back of the other, and then flip that hand over and alternate back-and- forth.
To test similar function in the lower extremities, the patient touches their heel to their shin near the knee and slides it down toward the ankle, and then back again, repetitively.
Rapid, alternating movements are part of speech as well.

Testing posture and gait addresses functions of the spinocerebellum and the vestibulocerebellum because both are part of these activities.
A subtest called station begins with the patient standing in a normal position to check for the placement of the feet and balance.
The patient is asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability to maintain balance and posture during movement.
Though the station subtest appears to be similar to the Romberg test, the difference is that the patient‚Äôs eyes are open during station.
The Romberg test has the patient stand still with the eyes closed.
Any changes in posture would be the result of proprioceptive deficits, and the patient is able to recover when they open their eyes.
Subtests of walking begin with having the patient walk normally for a distance away from the examiner, and then turn andreturntothestartingposition.Theexaminerwatchesforabnormalplacementofthefeetandthemovementofthearms relative to the movement.
The patient is then asked to walk with a few different variations.
Tandem gait is when the patient places the heel of one foot against the toe of the other foot and walks in a straight line in that manner.
Walking only on the heels or only on the toes will test additional aspects of balance.
Ataxia A movement disorder of the cerebellum is referred to as ataxia.
It presents as a loss of coordination in voluntary movements.
Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that cause balance problems, primarily in proprioception and equilibrium.When the problem is observed in movement,it is ascribed to cerebellardamage.Sensory and vestibularataxia would likely also present with problems in gait and station.
Ataxia is often the result of exposure to exogenous substances, focal lesions, or a genetic disorder.
Focal lesions include strokes affecting the cerebellar arteries, tumors that may impinge on the cerebellum, trauma to the back of the head and neck, or MS. Alcohol intoxication or drugs such as ketamine cause ataxia, but it is often reversible.
Mercury in fish can cause ataxia as well.
Hereditary conditions can lead to degeneration of the cerebellum or spinal cord, as well as malformation of the brain, or the abnormal accumulation of copper seen in W ilson‚Äôs disease.
Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/stationtest) to see a test for station.
Station refers to the position a person adopts when they are standing still.

An abnormal finding in the test of station is if the feet are placed far apart.
Why would a wide stance suggest problems with cerebellar function?CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 675 The Field Sobriety Test The neurological exam has been described as a clinical tool throughout this chapter.
It is also useful in other ways.
A variation of the coordination exam is the Field Sobriety Test (FST) used to assess whether drivers are under the influence of alcohol.
The cerebellum is crucial for coordinated movements such as keeping balance while walking, or moving appendicular musculature on the basis of proprioceptive feedback.
The cerebellum is also very sensitive to ethanol, the particular type of alcohol found in beer, wine, and liquor.
Walking in a straight line involves comparing the motor command from the primary motor cortex to the proprioceptiveandvestibularsensoryfeedback,aswellasfollowingthevisualguideofthewhitelineonthesideofthe road.Whenthecerebellumiscompromisedbyalcohol,thecerebellumcannotcoordinatethesemovementseffectively, and maintaining balance becomes difficult.
Another common aspect of the FST is to have the driver extend their arms out wide and touch their fingertip to their nose, usually with their eyes closed.
The point of this is to remove the visual feedback for the movement and force the driver to rely just on proprioceptive information about the movement and position of their fingertip relative to their nose.
With eyes open, the corrections to the movement of the arm might be so small as to be hard to see, but proprioceptive feedback is not as immediate and broader movements of the arm will probably be needed, particularly if the cerebellum is affected by alcohol.
Reciting the alphabet backwards is not always a component of the FST, but its relationship to neurological function is interesting.
There is a cognitive aspect to remembering how the alphabet goes and how to recite it backwards.
That is actually a variation of the mental status subtest of repeating the months backwards.
However, the cerebellum is important because speech production is a coordinated activity.
The speech rapid alternating movement subtest is specifically using the consonant changes of ‚Äúlah-kah-pah‚Äù to assess coordinated movements of the lips, tongue, pharynx, and palate.
But the entire alphabet, especially in the nonrehearsed backwards order, pushes this type ofcoordinatedmovementquitefar.Itisrelatedtothereasonthatspeechbecomesslurredwhenapersonisintoxicated.676

Localizing damage to the spinal cord is related to assessments of the peripheral projections mapped to dermatomes.
Sensory tests address the various submodalities of the somatic senses: touch, temperature, vibration, pain, and proprioception.
Results of the subtests can point to trauma in the spinal cord gray matter, white matter, or even in connections to the cerebral cortex.
Motor tests focus on the function of the muscles and the connections of the descending motor pathway.
Muscle tone and strength are tested for upper and lower extremities.
Input to the muscles comes from the descending cortical input of upper motor neurons and the direct innervation of lower motor neurons.

The motor commands from the cerebral hemispheres travel along the corticospinal pathway, which passes through the pons.
Collateral branches of these fibers synapse on neurons in the pons, which then project into the cerebellar cortex through the middle cerebellar peduncles.
Ascending sensory feedback, entering through the inferior cerebellar peduncles, providesinformationaboutmotorperformance.Thecerebellarcortexcomparesthecommandtotheactualperformanceand can adjust the descending input to compensate for any mismatch.

Deficits in cerebellar function result in ataxias, or a specific kind of movement disorder.
The root cause of the ataxia may be the sensory input‚Äîeither the proprioceptive input from the spinal cord or the equilibrium input from the vestibular system, or direct damage to the cerebellum by stroke, trauma, hereditary factors, or toxins.680 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS 1.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ neuroexam) that provides a demonstration of the neurological exam‚Äîa series of tests that can be performed rapidlywhenapatientisinitiallybroughtintoanemergency department.
The exam can be repeated on a regular basis to keep a record of how and if neurological function changes over time.
In what order were the sections of the neurological exam tested in this video, and which section seemed to be left out?
2.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ neuroexam2) for an introduction to the neurological exam.
Studying the neurological exam can give insight into how structure and function in the nervous system are interdependent.
This is a tool both in the clinic and in the classroom, but for different reasons.
In the clinic, this is a powerful but simple tool to assess a patient‚Äôs neurological function.Intheclassroom,itisadifferentwaytothinkabout the nervous system.
Though medical technology provides noninvasive imaging and real-time functional data, the presenter says these cannot replace the history at the core of the medical examination.
What does history mean in the context of medical practice?
3.Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/3word) to learn about a young man who texts his fianc√©e in a panic as he finds that he is having trouble remembering things.
At the hospital, a neurologist administers the mental status exam, which is mostly normal except for the three-word recall test.
The young man could not recall them even 30 seconds after hearing them and repeating them back to the doctor.
An undiscovered mass in the mediastinum region was found to be Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system and likely caused antibodies to attack the nervous system.
The patient eventually regained his ability to remember, though the events in the hospital werealwayselusive.Consideringthattheeffectsonmemory weretemporary,butresultedinthelossofthespecificevents of the hospital stay, what regions of the brain were likely to have been affected by the antibodies and what type of memory does that represent?
4.Watch the video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2brains) titled ‚ÄúThe Man With Two Brains‚Äù to see the neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga introduce a patient he has worked with foryearswhohashadhiscorpuscallosumcut,separatinghis twocerebralhemispheres.Afewtestsareruntodemonstrate how this manifests in tests of cerebral function.
Unlike normal people, this patient can perform two independent tasks at the same time because the lines of communication between the right and left sides of his brain have been removed.
Whereas a person with an intact corpus callosum cannot overcome the dominance of one hemisphere overthe other, this patient can.
If the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant in the majority of people, why would right- handedness be most common?
5.Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ facialnerve) to see an examination of the facial nerve using some simple tests.
The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression.
Severe deficits will be obvious in watching someone use those muscles for normal control.
One side of the face might not move like the other side.
But directed tests, especially for contraction against resistance, require a formal testing of the muscles.
The muscles of the upper and lower face need to be tested.
The strength test in this video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut and the examiner trying to pry her eyes open.
Why does the examiner ask her to try a second time?
6.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2point) to see a quick demonstration of two-point discrimination.
Touching a specialized caliper to the surface of the skin will measure the distance between two points that are perceived asdistinctstimuliversusasinglestimulus.Thepatientkeeps theireyesclosedwhiletheexaminerswitchesbetweenusing both points of the caliper or just one.
The patient then must indicate whether one or two stimuli are in contact with the skin.
Why is the distance between the caliper points closer on the fingertips as opposed to the palm of the hand?
And what do you think the distance would be on the arm, or the shoulder?
7.Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ reflextest) to see how to test reflexes in the abdomen.
Testing reflexes of the trunk is not commonly performed in the neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem with the thoracic segments of the spinal cord, a series of superficial reflexes of the abdomen can localize function to those segments.
If contraction is not observed when the skin lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is stimulated, what level of the spinal cord may be damaged?
8.Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ stationtest) to see a test for station.
Station refers to the position a person adopts when they are standing still.
The examiner would look for issues with balance, which coordinates proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual informationinthecerebellum.Totesttheabilityofasubject tomaintainbalance,askingthemtostandorhopononefoot can be more demanding.

(credit: ‚Äúseenthroughmylense‚Äù/flickr.com) Introduction Chapter Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the contributions of the endocrine system to homeostasis ‚Ä¢Discuss the chemical composition of hormones and the mechanisms of hormone action ‚Ä¢Summarize the site of production, regulation, and effects of the hormones of the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal glandsCHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 685 ‚Ä¢Discuss the hormonal regulation of the reproductive system ‚Ä¢Explain the role of the pancreatic endocrine cells in the regulation of blood glucose ‚Ä¢Identify the hormones released by the heart, kidneys, and other or gans with secondary endocrine functions ‚Ä¢Discuss several common diseases associated with endocrine system dysfunction ‚Ä¢Discuss the embryonic development of, and the effects of aging on, the endocrine system You may never have thought of it this way, but when you send a text message to two friends to meet you at the dining hall at six, you‚Äôre sending digital signals that (you hope) will affect their behavior‚Äîeven though they are some distance away.
Similarly, certain cells send chemical signals to other cells in the body that influence their behavior.
This long-distance intercellular communication, coordination, and control is critical for homeostasis, and it is the fundamental function of the endocrine system.
17.1|An Overview of the Endocrine System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Distinguish the types of intercellular communication, their importance, mechanisms, and ef fects ‚Ä¢Identify the major organs and tissues of the endocrine system and their location in the body Communication is a process in which a sender transmits signals to one or more receivers to control and coordinate actions.
In the human body, two major organ systems participate in relatively ‚Äúlong distance‚Äù communication: the nervous system and the endocrine system.
Together, these two systems are primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the body.
Neural and Endocrine Signaling Thenervoussystemusestwotypesofintercellularcommunication‚Äîelectricalandchemicalsignaling‚Äîeitherbythedirect action of an electrical potential, or in the latter case, through the action of chemical neurotransmitters such as serotonin or norepinephrine.Neurotransmittersactlocallyandrapidly.Whenanelectricalsignalintheformofanactionpotentialarrives at the synaptic terminal, they diffuse across the synaptic cleft (the gap between a sending neuron and a receiving neuron or muscle cell).
Once the neurotransmitters interact (bind) with receptors on the receiving (post-synaptic) cell, the receptor stimulation is transduced into a response such as continued electrical signaling or modification of cellular response.
The target cell responds within milliseconds of receiving the chemical ‚Äúmessage‚Äù; this response then ceases very quickly once the neural signaling ends.
In this way, neural communication enables body functions that involve quick, brief actions, such asmovement,sensation,andcognition.Incontrast,the endocrinesystem usesjustonemethodofcommunication:chemical signaling.
These signals are sent by the endocrine organs, which secrete chemicals‚Äîthe hormone‚Äîinto the extracellular fluid.
Hormones are transported primarily via the bloodstream throughout the body, where they bind to receptors on target cells,inducingacharacteristicresponse.Asaresult,endocrinesignalingrequiresmoretimethanneuralsignalingtoprompt a response in target cells, though the precise amount of time varies with different hormones.
For example, the hormones releasedwhenyouareconfrontedwithadangerousorfrighteningsituation,calledthefight-or-flightresponse,occurbythe release of adrenal hormones‚Äîepinephrine and norepinephrine‚Äîwithin seconds.
In contrast, it may take up to 48 hours for target cells to respond to certain reproductive hormones.
Visit this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hormonebind) to watch an animation of the events that occur when a hormone binds to a cell membrane receptor.
What is the secondary messenger made by adenylyl cyclase during the activation of liver cells by epinephrine?
In addition, endocrine signaling is typically less specific than neural signaling.
The same hormone may play a role in a variety of different physiological processes depending on the target cells involved.
For example, the hormone oxytocin686 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 promotes uterine contractions in women in labor.
It is also important in breastfeeding, and may be involved in the sexual response and in feelings of emotional attachment in both males and females.
In general, the nervous system involves quick responses to rapid changes in the external environment, and the endocrine system is usually slower acting‚Äîtaking care of the internal environment of the body, maintaining homeostasis, and controlling reproduction (Table 17.1).
So how does the fight-or-flight response that was mentioned earlier happen so quickly if hormones are usually slower acting?
It is because the two systems are connected.
It is the fast action of the nervous system in response to the danger in the environment that stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete their hormones.
As a result, the nervous system can cause rapid endocrine responses to keep up with sudden changes in both the external and internal environments when necessary.
Endocrine and Nervous Systems Endocrine system Nervous system Signaling mechanism(s) Chemical Chemical/electrical Primary chemical signal Hormones Neurotransmitters Distance traveled Long or short Always short Response time Fast or slow Always fast Environment targeted Internal Internal and external Table 17.1 Structures of the Endocrine System The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function.
Theendocrine gland is the major player in this system.
The primary function of these ductless glands is to secrete their hormones directly into the surrounding fluid.
The interstitial fluid and the blood vessels then transport the hormones throughout the body.
The endocrine system includes the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal glands (Figure 17.2).Someoftheseglandshavebothendocrineandnon-endocrinefunctions.Forexample,thepancreascontainscellsthat function in digestion as well as cells that secrete the hormones insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood glucose levels.
The hypothalamus, thymus, heart, kidneys, stomach, small intestine, liver, skin, female ovaries, and male testes are other organsthatcontaincellswithendocrinefunction.Moreover,adiposetissuehaslongbeenknowntoproducehormones,and recent research has revealed that even bone tissue has endocrine functions.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 687 Figure 17.2 Endocrine System Endocrine glands and cells are located throughout the body and play an important role in homeostasis.
The ductless endocrine glands are not to be confused with the body‚Äôs exocrine system , whose glands release their secretions through ducts.
Examples of exocrine glands include the sebaceous and sweat glands of the skin.
As just noted, the pancreas also has an exocrine function: most of its cells secrete pancreatic juice through the pancreatic and accessory ducts to the lumen of the small intestine.
Other Types of Chemical Signaling In endocrine signaling, hormones secreted into the extracellular fluid diffuse into the blood or lymph, and can then travel great distances throughout the body.
In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell.
An autocrine (auto- = ‚Äúself‚Äù) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it.
Interleukin-1, or IL-1, is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in inflammatory response.
The cells that secrete IL-1 have receptors on their cell surface that bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling.
Localintercellularcommunicationistheprovinceofthe paracrine,alsocalledaparacrinefactor,whichisachemical thatinducesaresponseinneighboringcells.Althoughparacrinesmayenterthebloodstream,theirconcentrationisgenerally too low to elicit a response from distant tissues.
A familiar example to those with asthma is histamine, a paracrine that is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree.
Histamine causes the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi to constrict, narrowing the airways.
Another example is the neurotransmitters of the nervous system, which act only locally within the synaptic cleft.688 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Endocrinologist Endocrinology is a specialty in the field of medicine that focuses on the treatment of endocrine system disorders.
Endocrinologists‚Äîmedical doctors who specialize in this field‚Äîare experts in treating diseases associated with hormonal systems, ranging from thyroid disease to diabetes mellitus.
Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease through the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland.
Patients who are referred to endocrinologists may have signs and symptoms or blood test results that suggest excessive or impaired functioning of an endocrine gland or endocrine cells.
The endocrinologist may order additional blood tests to determine whether the patient‚Äôs hormonal levels are abnormal, or they may stimulate or suppress the function of the suspect endocrine gland and then have blood taken for analysis.
Treatment varies according to the diagnosis.
Some endocrine disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, may respond to lifestyle changes such as modest weight loss,adoptionofahealthydiet,andregularphysicalactivity.Otherdisordersmayrequiremedication,suchashormone replacement, and routine monitoring by the endocrinologist.
These include disorders of the pituitary gland that can affect growth and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems.
Some patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany aging.
These patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy intended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones.
In addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases.
17.2|Hormones By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the three major classes of hormones on the basis of chemical structure ‚Ä¢Compare and contrast intracellular and cell membrane hormone receptors ‚Ä¢Describe signaling pathways that involve cAMP and IP3 ‚Ä¢Identify several factors that influence a target cell‚Äôs response ‚Ä¢Discuss the role of feedback loops and humoral, hormonal, and neural stimuli in hormone control Although a given hormone may travel throughout the body in the bloodstream, it will affect the activity only of its target cells; that is, cells with receptors for that particular hormone.
Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a chain of events is initiated that leads to the target cell‚Äôs response.

Hormones derived from amino acids include amines, peptides, and proteins.
Those derived from lipids include steroids (Figure 17.3).
These chemical groups affect a hormone‚Äôs distribution, the type of receptors it binds to, and other aspects of its function.690 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 17.3 Amine, Peptide, Protein, and Steroid Hormone Structure Amine Hormones Hormonesderivedfromthemodificationofaminoacidsarereferredtoasaminehormones.Typically,theoriginalstructure of the amino acid is modified such that a ‚ÄìCOOH, or carboxyl, group is removed, whereas the ‚àíNH3+, or amine, group remains.
Aminehormonesaresynthesizedfromtheaminoacidstryptophanortyrosine.Anexampleofahormonederivedfrom tryptophan is melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland and helps regulate circadian rhythm.
Tyrosine derivatives include the metabolism-regulating thyroid hormones, as well as the catecholamines, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are secreted by the adrenal medulla and play a role in the fight-or-flight response,whereasdopamineissecretedbythehypothalamusandinhibitsthereleaseofcertainanteriorpituitaryhormones.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 691 Peptide and Protein Hormones Whereastheaminehormonesarederivedfromasingleaminoacid,peptideandproteinhormonesconsistofmultipleamino acids that link to form an amino acid chain.
Peptide hormones consist of short chains of amino acids, whereas protein hormones are longer polypeptides.
Both types are synthesized like other body proteins: DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into an amino acid chain.
Examples of peptide hormones include antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a pituitary hormone important in fluid balance, and atrial-natriuretic peptide, which is produced by the heart and helps to decrease blood pressure.
Some examples of protein hormones include growth hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which has an attached carbohydrate group and is thus classified as a glycoprotein.
FSH helps stimulate the maturation of eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the testes.
Steroid Hormones The primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids.
Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol.
For example, the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogens‚Äîwhich are produced by the gonads (testes and ovaries)‚Äîare steroid hormones.
The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is involved in osmoregulation, and cortisol, which plays a role in metabolism.
Like cholesterol, steroid hormones are not soluble in water (they are hydrophobic).
Because blood is water-based, lipid-derived hormones must travel to their target cell bound to a transport protein.
This more complex structure extends the half-lifeof steroid hormones much longer than thatof hormones derivedfrom aminoacids.
A hormone‚Äôs half-lifeis the timerequiredforhalftheconcentrationofthehormonetobedegraded.Forexample,thelipid-derivedhormonecortisolhas a half-life of approximately 60 to 90 minutes.
In contrast, the amino acid‚Äìderived hormone epinephrine has a half-life of approximately one minute.
Pathways of Hormone Action The message a hormone sends is received by a hormone receptor, a protein located either inside the cell or within the cell membrane.
The receptor will process the message by initiating other signaling events or cellular mechanisms that result in thetargetcell‚Äôsresponse.Hormonereceptorsrecognizemoleculeswithspecificshapesandsidegroups,andrespondonlyto thosehormonesthatarerecognized.Thesametypeofreceptormaybelocatedoncellsindifferentbodytissues,andtrigger somewhatdifferentresponses.Thus,theresponsetriggeredbyahormonedependsnotonlyonthehormone,butalsoonthe target cell.
Once the target cell receives the hormone signal, it can respond in a variety of ways.
The response may include the stimulation of protein synthesis, activation or deactivation of enzymes, alteration in the permeability of the cell membrane, altered rates of mitosis and cell growth, and stimulation of the secretion of products.
Moreover, a single hormone may be capable of inducing different responses in a given cell.

Thyroid hormones, which contain benzene rings studded with iodine, are also lipid-soluble and can enter the cell.
Thelocationofsteroidandthyroidhormonebindingdiffersslightly:asteroidhormonemaybindtoitsreceptorwithin the cytosol or within the nucleus.
In either case, this binding generates a hormone-receptor complex that moves toward the chromatin in the cell nucleus and binds to a particular segment of the cell‚Äôs DNA.
In contrast, thyroid hormones bind to receptors already bound to DNA.
For both steroid and thyroid hormones, binding of the hormone-receptor complex with DNA triggers transcription of a target gene to mRNA, which moves to the cytosol and directs protein synthesis by ribosomes.692 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 17.4 Binding of Lipid-Soluble Hormones A steroid hormone directly initiates the production of proteins within a target cell.
Steroid hormones easily diffuse through the cell membrane.
The hormone binds to its receptor in the cytosol, forming a receptor‚Äìhormone complex.
The receptor‚Äìhormone complex then enters the nucleus and binds to the target gene on the DNA.
Transcription of the gene creates a messenger RNA that is translated into the desired protein within the cytoplasm.
Pathways Involving Cell Membrane Hormone Receptors Hydrophilic, or water-soluble, hormones are unable to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and must therefore pass on their message to a receptor located at the surface of the cell.
Except for thyroid hormones, which are lipid-soluble, all amino acid‚Äìderived hormones bind to cell membrane receptors that are located, at least in part, on the extracellularsurfaceofthecellmembrane.Therefore,theydonotdirectlyaffectthetranscriptionoftargetgenes,butinstead initiate a signaling cascade that is carried out by a molecule called a second messenger .
In this case, the hormone is called afirst messenger.
The second messenger used by most hormones is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) .
In the cAMP second messenger system, a water-soluble hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane (Step 1 in Figure 17.5).
This receptor is associated with an intracellular component called a G protein, and binding of the hormone activates the G- protein component (Step 2).
The activated G protein in turn activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase , also known as adenylate cyclase (Step 3), which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Step 4).
As the second messenger, cAMP activates a type of enzyme called a protein kinase that is present in the cytosol (Step 5).
Activated protein kinases initiate aphosphorylation cascade, in which multiple protein kinases phosphorylate (add a phosphate group to) numerous and various cellular proteins, including other enzymes (Step 6).CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 693 Figure 17.5 Binding of Water-Soluble Hormones Water-soluble hormones cannot diffuse through the cell membrane.
These hormones must bind to a surface cell-membrane receptor.
The receptor then initiates a cell- signaling pathway within the cell involving G proteins, adenylyl cyclase, the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), and protein kinases.
In the final step, these protein kinases phosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm.
This activates proteins in the cell that carry out the changes specified by the hormone.
Thephosphorylationofcellularproteinscantriggerawidevarietyofeffects,fromnutrientmetabolismtothesynthesis of different hormones and other products.
The effects vary according to the type of target cell, the G proteins and kinases involved, and the phosphorylation of proteins.
Examples of hormones that use cAMP as a second messenger include calcitonin, which is important for bone construction and regulating blood calcium levels; glucagon, which plays a role in blood glucose levels; and thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the release of T 3and T4from the thyroid gland.
Overall, the phosphorylation cascade significantly increases the efficiency, speed, and specificity of the hormonal response, as thousands of signaling events can be initiated simultaneously in response to a very low concentration of hormone in the bloodstream.
However, the duration of the hormone signal is short, as cAMP is quickly deactivated by the enzymephosphodiesterase (PDE), which is located in the cytosol.
The action of PDE helps to ensure that a target cell‚Äôs response ceases quickly unless new hormones arrive at the cell membrane.
Importantly, there are also G proteins that decrease the levels of cAMP in the cell in response to hormone binding.
For example, when growth hormone‚Äìinhibiting hormone (GHIH), also known as somatostatin, binds to its receptors in the pituitary gland, the level of cAMP decreases, thereby inhibiting the secretion of human growth hormone.
Not all water-soluble hormones initiate the cAMP second messenger system.
One common alternative system uses calcium ions as a second messenger.
In this system, G proteins activate the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), which functions similarly to adenylyl cyclase.
Once activated, PLC cleaves a membrane-bound phospholipid into two molecules: diacylglycerol (DAG) andinositol triphosphate (IP 3).
Like cAMP, DAG activates protein kinases that initiate a phosphorylationcascade.Atthesametime,IP 3causescalciumionstobereleasedfromstoragesiteswithinthecytosol,such as from within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
The calcium ions then act as second messengers in two ways: they can influence enzymatic and other cellular activities directly, or they can bind to calcium-binding proteins, the most common of which is calmodulin.
Upon binding calcium, calmodulin is able to modulate protein kinase within the cell.
Examples of hormones that use calcium ions as a second messenger system include angiotensin II, which helps regulate blood pressure through vasoconstriction, and growth hormone‚Äìreleasing hormone (GHRH), which causes the pituitary gland to release growth hormones.
Factors Affecting Target Cell Response You will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a response.
But several other factors influence the target cell response.
For example, the presence of a significant level of a hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone.
This process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels.
When the level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase their number of receptors.
This694 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present.
Cells can also alter the sensitivity of the receptors themselves to various hormones.
Two or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways.
The three most common types of interaction are as follows: ‚Ä¢The permissive effect, in which the presence of one hormone enables another hormone to act.
For example, thyroid hormones have complex permissive relationships with certain reproductive hormones.
A dietary deficiency of iodine, a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development and functioning.
‚Ä¢The synergistic effect, in which two hormones with similar effects produce an amplified response.
In some cases, two hormones are required for an adequate response.
For example, two different reproductive hormones‚ÄîFSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries‚Äîare required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells).
‚Ä¢The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects.
A familiar example is the effect of two pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon.
Insulin increases the liver‚Äôs storage of glucose as glycogen, decreasing blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing blood glucose.
Regulation of Hormone Secretion To prevent abnormal hormone levels and a potential disease state, hormone levels must be tightly controlled.
The body maintains this control by balancing hormone production and degradation.
Feedback loops govern the initiation and maintenance of most hormone secretion in response to various stimuli.
Role of Feedback Loops The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here.
Positive feedback loops are characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release.
The release of oxytocin duringchildbirthisapositivefeedbackloop.Theinitialreleaseofoxytocinbeginstosignaltheuterinemusclestocontract, which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch.
This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify.
The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child.
Themorecommonmethodofhormoneregulationisthenegativefeedbackloop.Negativefeedbackischaracterizedby the inhibition of further secretion of a hormone in response to adequate levels of that hormone.
This allows blood levels of thehormonetoberegulatedwithinanarrowrange.Anexampleofanegativefeedbackloopisthereleaseofglucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal glands, as directed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
As glucocorticoid concentrations in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional glucocorticoid secretion ( Figure 17.6 ).CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 695 Figure 17.6 Negative Feedback Loop The release of adrenal glucocorticoids is stimulated by the release of hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
This signaling is inhibited when glucocorticoid levels become elevated by causing negative signals to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.
Role of Endocrine Gland Stimuli Reflexes triggered by both chemical and neural stimuli control endocrine activity.
These reflexes may be simple, involving onlyonehormoneresponse,ortheymaybemorecomplexandinvolvemanyhormones,asisthecasewiththehypothalamic control of various anterior pituitary‚Äìcontrolled hormones.
Humoral stimuli are changes in blood levels of non-hormone chemicals, such as nutrients or ions, which cause the releaseorinhibitionofahormoneto,inturn,maintainhomeostasis.Forexample,osmoreceptorsinthehypothalamusdetect changesinbloodosmolarity(theconcentrationofsolutesinthebloodplasma).Ifbloodosmolarityistoohigh,meaningthat theblood is not diluteenough, osmoreceptorssignalthehypothalamusto releaseADH.

The regulation of blood glucose is another example.
High blood glucose levels cause the release of insulin from the pancreas, which increases glucose uptake by cells and liver storage of glucose as glycogen.

When an individual perceives danger, sympathetic neurons signal the adrenal glands to secrete norepinephrine and epinephrine.
The two hormones dilate blood vessels, increase the heart and respiratory rate, and suppress the digestive and immune systems.

BPA is used in the manufacturing of hard plastics and epoxy resins.
Common food-related items that may containBPAincludetheliningofaluminumcans,plasticfood-storagecontainers,drinkingcups,aswellasbabybottles and ‚Äúsippy‚Äù cups.
Other uses of BPA include medical equipment, dental fillings, and the lining of water pipes.
Research suggests that BPA is an endocrine disruptor, meaning that it negatively interferes with the endocrine system, particularly during the prenatal and postnatal development period.
In particular, BPA mimics the hormonal effects of estrogens and has the opposite effect‚Äîthat of androgens.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notes in their statement about BPA safety that although traditional toxicology studies have supported the safety of low levels of exposure to BPA, recent studies using novel approaches to test for subtle effects have led to some concern aboutthepotentialeffectsofBPAonthebrain,behavior,andprostateglandinfetuses,infants,andyoungchildren.The FDA is currently facilitating decreased use of BPA in food-related materials.
Many US companies have voluntarily removed BPA from baby bottles, ‚Äúsippy‚Äù cups, and the linings of infant formula cans, and most plastic reusable water bottles sold today boast that they are ‚ÄúBPA free.‚Äù In contrast, both Canada and the European Union have completely banned the use of BPA in baby products.
The potential harmful effects of BPA have been studied in both animal models and humans and include a large variety of health effects, such as developmental delay and disease.
For example, prenatal exposure to BPA during the firsttrimesterofhumanpregnancymaybeassociatedwithwheezingandaggressivebehaviorduringchildhood.Adults exposed to high levels of BPA may experience altered thyroid signaling and male sexual dysfunction.
BPA exposure during the prenatal or postnatal period of development in animal models has been observed to cause neurological delays, changes in brain structure and function, sexual dysfunction, asthma, and increased risk for multiple cancers.
In vitro studies have also shown that BPA exposure causes molecular changes that initiate the development of cancers of the breast, prostate, and brain.
Although these studies have implicated BPA in numerous ill health effects, some expertscautionthatsomeofthesestudiesmaybeflawedandthatmoreresearchneedstobedone.Inthemeantime,the FDA recommends that consumers take precautions to limit their exposure to BPA.
In addition to purchasing foods in packaging free of BPA, consumers should avoid carrying or storing foods or liquids in bottles with the recycling code 3or7.Foodsandliquidsshouldnotbemicrowave-heatedinanyformofplastic:usepaper,glass,orceramicsinstead.
17.3|The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Explaintheinterrelationshipsoftheanatomyandfunctionsofthehypothalamusandtheposteriorandanteriorlobes of the pituitary gland ‚Ä¢Identify the two hormones released from the posterior pituitary, their target cells, and their principal actions ‚Ä¢Identify the six hormones produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, their target cells, their principal actions, and their regulation by the hypothalamus The hypothalamus‚Äìpituitary complex can be thought of as the ‚Äúcommand center‚Äù of the endocrine system.
This complex secretes several hormones that directly produce responses in target tissues, as well as hormones that regulate the synthesis and secretion of hormones of other glands.
In addition, the hypothalamus‚Äìpituitary complex coordinates the messages of the endocrine and nervous systems.
In many cases, a stimulus received by the nervous system must pass through the hypothalamus‚Äìpituitary complex to be translated into hormones that can initiate a response.
Thehypothalamus isastructureofthediencephalonofthebrainlocatedanteriorandinferiortothethalamus(Figure 17.7).
It has both neural and endocrine functions, producing and secreting many hormones.
In addition, the hypothalamus is anatomically and functionally related to the pituitary gland (or hypophysis), a bean-sized organ suspended from it by a stem called the infundibulum (or pituitary stalk).
The pituitary gland is cradled within the sellaturcica of the sphenoid bone of the skull.
It consists of two lobes that arise from distinct parts of embryonic tissue: the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) is neural tissue, whereas the anterior pituitary (also known as the adenohypophysis) is glandular tissue that develops from the primitive digestive tract.
The hormones secreted by the posterior and anterior pituitary, and the intermediate zone between the lobes are summarized in Table 17.3.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 697 Figure 17.7 Hypothalamus‚ÄìPituitary Complex The hypothalamus region lies inferior and anterior to the thalamus.
It connects to the pituitary gland by the stalk-like infundibulum.
The pituitary gland consists of an anterior and posterior lobe, with each lobe secreting different hormones in response to signals from the hypothalamus.

The cell bodies of these regions rest in the hypothalamus, but their axons descend as the hypothalamic‚Äìhypophyseal tract within the infundibulum, and end in axon terminals that comprise the posterior pituitary (Figure 17.8 ).698 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 17.8 Posterior Pituitary Neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus release oxytocin (OT) or ADH into the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland.
These hormones are stored or released into the blood via the capillary plexus.
The posterior pituitary gland does not produce hormones, but rather stores and secretes hormones produced by the hypothalamus.
The paraventricular nuclei produce the hormone oxytocin, whereas the supraoptic nuclei produce ADH.
These hormones travel along the axons into storage sites in the axon terminals of the posterior pituitary.
In response to signals from the same hypothalamic neurons, the hormones are released from the axon terminals into the bloodstream.
Oxytocin When fetal development is complete, the peptide-derived hormone oxytocin (tocia- = ‚Äúchildbirth‚Äù) stimulates uterine contractionsanddilationofthecervix.Throughoutmostofpregnancy,oxytocinhormonereceptorsarenotexpressedathigh levelsintheuterus.Towardtheendofpregnancy,thesynthesisofoxytocinreceptorsintheuterusincreases,andthesmooth muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects.
Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism.
As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head toward the cervix.
In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus andreleasedfromthepituitary.Thisincreasestheintensityandeffectivenessofuterinecontractionsandpromptsadditional dilation of the cervix.
The feedback loop continues until birth.

Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to contribute to parent‚Äìnewborn bonding, known as attachment.
Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.
Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) The solute concentration of the blood, or blood osmolarity, may change in response to the consumption of certain foods and fluids, as well as in response to disease, injury, medications, or other factors.
Blood osmolarity is constantly monitored byosmoreceptors‚Äîspecializedcellswithinthehypothalamusthatareparticularlysensitivetotheconcentrationofsodium ions and other solutes.
In response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the osmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
The target cells of ADH are located in the tubular cells of the kidneys.
Its effect is to increase epithelial permeability to water, allowing increased water reabsorption.
The more water reabsorbed from the filtrate, the greater the amount of water that is returned to the bloodCHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 699 and the less that is excreted in the urine.
A greater concentration of water results in a reduced concentration of solutes.
ADH is also known as vasopressin because, in very high concentrations, it causes constriction of blood vessels, which increasesbloodpressurebyincreasingperipheralresistance.ThereleaseofADHiscontrolledbyanegativefeedbackloop.
As blood osmolarity decreases, the hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense the change and prompt a corresponding decrease in the secretion of ADH.
As a result, less water is reabsorbed from the urine filtrate.
Interestingly, drugs can affect the secretion of ADH.
For example, alcohol consumption inhibits the release of ADH, resulting in increased urine production that can eventually lead to dehydration and a hangover.
A disease called diabetes insipidus is characterized by chronic underproduction of ADH that causes chronic dehydration.
Because little ADH is produced and secreted, not enough water is reabsorbed by the kidneys.
Although patients feel thirsty, and increase their fluidconsumption,thisdoesn‚ÄôteffectivelydecreasethesoluteconcentrationintheirbloodbecauseADHlevelsarenothigh enough to trigger water reabsorption in the kidneys.
Electrolyte imbalances can occur in severe cases of diabetes insipidus.
Anterior Pituitary The anterior pituitary originates from the digestive tract in the embryo and migrates toward the brain during fetal development.
There are three regions: the pars distalis is the most anterior, the pars intermedia is adjacent to the posterior pituitary, and the pars tuberalis is a slender ‚Äútube‚Äù that wraps the infundibulum.
Recall that the posterior pituitary does not synthesize hormones, but merely stores them.
In contrast, the anterior pituitary does manufacture hormones.
However, the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary is regulated by two classes of hormones.
These hormones‚Äîsecreted by the hypothalamus‚Äîare the releasing hormones that stimulate the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary and the inhibiting hormones that inhibit secretion.
Hypothalamic hormones are secreted by neurons, but enter the anterior pituitary through blood vessels ( Figure 17.9 ).
Within the infundibulum is a bridge of capillaries that connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary.
This network, called the hypophyseal portal system, allows hypothalamic hormones to be transported to the anterior pituitary without first entering the systemic circulation.
The system originates from the superior hypophyseal artery, which branches off the carotid arteries and transports blood to the hypothalamus.
The branches of the superior hypophyseal artery form the hypophyseal portal system (see Figure 17.9).
Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones travel through a primary capillaryplexus totheportalveins,whichcarrythemintotheanteriorpituitary.Hormonesproducedbytheanteriorpituitary (in response to releasing hormones) enter a secondary capillary plexus, and from there drain into the circulation.700 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 17.9 Anterior Pituitary The anterior pituitary manufactures seven hormones.
The hypothalamus produces separate hormones that stimulate or inhibit hormone production in the anterior pituitary.
Hormones from the hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system.
The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones.
These are the growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), beta endorphin, and prolactin.
Of the hormones of the anterior pituitary, TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH are collectively referred to as tropic hormones (trope- = ‚Äúturning‚Äù) because they turn on or of f the function of other endocrine glands.
Growth Hormone Theendocrinesystemregulatesthegrowthofthehumanbody,proteinsynthesis,andcellularreplication.Amajorhormone involved in this process is growth hormone (GH), also called somatotropin‚Äîa protein hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland.
Its primary function is anabolic; it promotes protein synthesis and tissue building through direct and indirect mechanisms (Figure 17.10).
GH levels are controlled by the release of GHRH and GHIH (also known as somatostatin) from the hypothalamus.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 701 Figure 17.10 Hormonal Regulation of Growth Growth hormone (GH) directly accelerates the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones.
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and indirectly supports the formation of new proteins in muscle cells and bone.
Aglucose-sparingeffectoccurswhenGHstimulateslipolysis,orthebreakdownofadiposetissue,releasingfattyacids into the blood.
As a result, many tissues switch from glucose to fatty acids as their main energy source, which means that less glucose is taken up from the bloodstream.
GH also initiates the diabetogenic effect in which GH stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to glucose, which is then deposited into the blood.
The name ‚Äúdiabetogenic‚Äù is derived from the similarity in elevated blood glucose levels observed between individuals with untreated diabetes mellitus and individuals experiencing GH excess.
Blood glucose levels rise as the result of a combination of glucose-sparing and diabetogenic ef fects.
GH indirectly mediates growth and protein synthesis by triggering the liver and other tissues to produce a group of proteins called insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) .
These proteins enhance cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, or programmed cell death.
IGFs stimulate cells to increase their uptake of amino acids from the blood for protein synthesis.
Skeletal muscle and cartilage cells are particularly sensitive to stimulation from IGFs.
Dysfunction of the endocrine system‚Äôs control of growth can result in several disorders.
For example, gigantism is a disorder in children that is caused by the secretion of abnormally large amounts of GH, resulting in excessive growth.
A similar condition in adults is acromegaly , a disorder that results in the growth of bones in the face, hands, and feet in responsetoexcessivelevelsofGHinindividualswhohavestoppedgrowing.AbnormallylowlevelsofGHinchildrencan cause growth impairment‚Äîa disorder called pituitary dwarfism (also known as growth hormone deficiency).
Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone The activity of the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) , also called thyrotropin.
TSH is released from the anterior pituitary in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.
As discussed shortly, it triggers the secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.
In a classic negative feedback loop, elevated levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream then trigger a drop in production of TRH and subsequently TSH.
Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Theadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), also called corticotropin, stimulates the adrenal cortex (the more superficial ‚Äúbark‚Äù of the adrenal glands) to secrete corticosteroid hormones such as cortisol.
ACTH come from a precursor molecule702 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 known as pro-opiomelanotropin (POMC) which produces several biologically active molecules when cleaved, including ACTH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the brain opioid peptides known as endorphins.
The release of ACTH is regulated by the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus in response to normal physiologic rhythms.
A variety of stressors can also influence its release, and the role of ACTH in the stress response is discussed later in this chapter.
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone The endocrine glands secrete a variety of hormones that control the development and regulation of the reproductive system (these glands include the anterior pituitary, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads‚Äîthe testes in males and the ovaries in females).
Much of the development of the reproductive system occurs during puberty and is marked by the development of sex-specific characteristics in both male and female adolescents.
Puberty is initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a hormone produced and secreted by the hypothalamus.
GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete gonadotropins‚Äîhormones that regulate the function of the gonads.
The levels of GnRH are regulated through a negative feedback loop; high levels of reproductive hormones inhibit the release of GnRH.
Throughout life, gonadotropins regulate reproductive function and, in the case of women, the onset and cessation of reproductive capacity .
The gonadotropins include two glycoprotein hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the productionandmaturationofsexcells,orgametes,includingovainwomenandsperminmen.FSHalsopromotesfollicular growth; these follicles then release estrogens in the female ovaries.
Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation in women,aswellastheproductionofestrogensandprogesteronebytheovaries.LHstimulatesproductionoftestosteroneby the male testes.
Prolactin As its name implies, prolactin (PRL) promotes lactation (milk production) in women.
During pregnancy, it contributes to development of the mammary glands, and after birth, it stimulates the mammary glands to produce breast milk.
However, the effects of prolactin depend heavily upon the permissive effects of estrogens, progesterone, and other hormones.
And as noted earlier, the let-down of milk occurs in response to stimulation from oxytocin.
Inanon-pregnantwoman,prolactinsecretionisinhibitedbyprolactin-inhibitinghormone(PIH),whichisactuallythe neurotransmitter dopamine, and is released from neurons in the hypothalamus.
Only during pregnancy do prolactin levels rise in response to prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) from the hypothalamus.
Intermediate Pituitary: Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone The cells in the zone between the pituitary lobes secrete a hormone known as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) that is formed by cleavage of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor protein.
Local production of MSH in the skin is responsible for melanin production in response to UV light exposure.
The role of MSH made by the pituitary is more complicated.
For instance, people with lighter skin generally have the same amount of MSH as people with darker skin.
Nevertheless, this hormone is capable of darkening of the skin by inducing melanin production in the skin‚Äôs melanocytes.
Women also show increased MSH production during pregnancy; in combination with estrogens, it can lead to darker skin pigmentation, especially the skin of the areolas and labia minora.

Which hormone is released by the pituitary to stimulate the thyroid gland?704 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 17.4|The Thyroid Gland By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the location and anatomy of the thyroid gland ‚Ä¢Discuss the synthesis of triiodothyronine and thyroxine ‚Ä¢Explain the role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of basal metabolism ‚Ä¢Identify the hormone produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid Abutterfly-shapedorgan,the thyroidgland islocatedanteriortothetrachea,justinferiortothelarynx(Figure17.12).The medial region, called the isthmus, is flanked by wing-shaped left and right lobes.
Each of the thyroid lobes are embedded withparathyroidglands,primarilyontheirposteriorsurfaces.Thetissueofthethyroidglandiscomposedmostlyofthyroid follicles.
The follicles are made up of a central cavity filled with a sticky fluid called colloid.
Surrounded by a wall of epithelial follicle cells, the colloid is the center of thyroid hormone production, and that production is dependent on the hormones‚Äô essential and unique component: iodine.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 705 Figure 17.12 Thyroid Gland The thyroid gland is located in the neck where it wraps around the trachea.
(a) Anterior view of the thyroid gland.
(b) Posterior view of the thyroid gland.
(c) The glandular tissue is composed primarily of thyroid follicles.
The larger parafollicular cells often appear within the matrix of follicle cells.
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) Synthesis and Release of Thyroid Hormones Hormones are produced in the colloid when atoms of the mineral iodine attach to a glycoprotein, called thyroglobulin, that is secreted into the colloid by the follicle cells.
The following steps outline the hormones‚Äô assembly: 1.Binding of TSH to its receptors in the follicle cells of the thyroid gland causes the cells to actively transport iodide ions (I‚Äì) across their cell membrane, from the bloodstream into the cytosol.
As a result, the concentration of iodide ions ‚Äútrapped‚Äù in the follicular cells is many times higher than the concentration in the bloodstream.706 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 2.Iodideionsthenmovetothelumenofthefolliclecellsthatborderthecolloid.There,theionsundergooxidation(their negatively charged electrons are removed).
The oxidation of two iodide ions (2 I‚Äì) results in iodine (I 2), which passes through the follicle cell membrane into the colloid.
3.In the colloid, peroxidase enzymes link the iodine to the tyrosine amino acids in thyroglobulin to produce two intermediaries: a tyrosine attached to one iodine and a tyrosine attached to two iodines.
When one of each of these intermediaries is linked by covalent bonds, the resulting compound is triiodothyronine (T3), a thyroid hormone with three iodines.
Much more commonly, two copies of the second intermediary bond, forming tetraiodothyronine, also known as thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone with four iodines.
These hormones remain in the colloid center of the thyroid follicles until TSH stimulates endocytosis of colloid back into the follicle cells.
There, lysosomal enzymes break apart the thyroglobulin colloid, releasing free T 3and T4, which diffuse across the follicle cell membrane and enter the bloodstream.
In the bloodstream, less than one percent of the circulating T 3and T4remains unbound.
This free T 3and T4can cross the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and be taken up by cells.
The remaining 99 percent of circulating T 3and T4is bound to specialized transport proteins called thyroxine-binding globulins (TBGs), to albumin, or to other plasma proteins.
This ‚Äúpackaging‚Äù prevents their free diffusion into body cells.
When blood levels of T 3and T4begin to decline, bound T 3and T4are released from these plasma proteins and readily cross the membrane of target cells.
T 3is more potent than T 4, and many cells convert T 4to T3through the removal of an iodine atom.
Regulation of TH Synthesis The release of T 3and T4from the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
As shown in Figure 17.13,lowbloodlevelsofT 3andT4stimulatethereleaseofthyrotropin-releasinghormone(TRH)fromthehypothalamus, which triggers secretion of TSH from the anterior pituitary.
In turn, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete T 3and T4.
The levels of TRH, TSH, T 3, and T4are regulated by a negative feedback system in which increasing levels of T 3and T4 decrease the production and secretion of TSH.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 707 Figure 17.13 Classic Negative Feedback Loop A classic negative feedback loop controls the regulation of thyroid hormone levels.
Functions of Thyroid Hormones The thyroid hormones, T 3and T4, are often referred to as metabolic hormones because their levels influence the body‚Äôs basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy used by the body at rest.
When T 3and T4bind to intracellular receptors located on the mitochondria, they cause an increase in nutrient breakdown and the use of oxygen to produce ATP.
In addition, T 3 andT4initiatethetranscriptionofgenesinvolvedinglucoseoxidation.Althoughthesemechanismspromptcellstoproduce moreATP,theprocessisinefficient,andanabnormallyincreasedlevelofheatisreleasedasabyproductofthesereactions.
This so-called calorigenic effect (calor- = ‚Äúheat‚Äù) raises body temperature.
Adequate levels of thyroid hormones are also required for protein synthesis and for fetal and childhood tissue development and growth.
They are especially critical for normal development of the nervous system both in utero and in early childhood, and they continue to support neurological function in adults.
As noted earlier, these thyroid hormones have a complex interrelationship with reproductive hormones, and deficiencies can influence libido, fertility, and other aspects of reproductive function.
Finally, thyroid hormones increase the body‚Äôs sensitivity to catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla by upregulation of receptors in the blood vessels.
When levels of T 3and T4hormones are excessive, this effect accelerates the heart rate, strengthens the heartbeat, and increases blood pressure.
Becausethyroidhormonesregulatemetabolism,heatproduction,proteinsynthesis,andmanyotherbodyfunctions,thyroid disorders can have severe and widespread consequences.708 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Endocrine System: Iodine Deficiency, Hypothyroidism, and Hyperthyroidism As discussed above, dietary iodine is required for the synthesis of T 3and T4.
But for much of the world‚Äôs population, foods do not provide adequate levels of this mineral, because the amount varies according to the level in the soil in which the food was grown, as well as the irrigation and fertilizers used.
Marine fish and shrimp tend to have high levels because they concentrate iodine from seawater, but many people in landlocked regions lack access to seafood.
Thus, the primary source of dietary iodine in many countries is iodized salt.
Fortification of salt with iodine began in the United States in 1924, and international efforts to iodize salt in the world‚Äôs poorest nations continue today.
Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize T 3and T4, leading to a variety of severe disorders.
When T 3and T4cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts.
As a result of this hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid.
The accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter(Figure 17.14).
A goiter is only a visible indication of the deficiency.
Other iodine deficiency disorders include impaired growth and development, decreased fertility, and prenatal and infant death.
Moreover, iodine deficiency is the primary cause of preventable mental retardation worldwide.
Neonatal hypothyroidism (cretinism) is characterized by cognitive deficits, short stature, and sometimes deafness and muteness in children and adults born to mothers who were iodine- deficient during pregnancy.
Figure 17.14 Goiter (credit: ‚ÄúAlmazi‚Äù/Wikimedia Commons) In areas of the world with access to iodized salt, dietary deficiency is rare.
Instead, inflammation of the thyroid gland is the more common cause of low blood levels of thyroid hormones.
Called hypothyroidism, the condition is characterized by a low metabolic rate, weight gain, cold extremities, constipation, reduced libido, menstrual irregularities, and reduced mental activity.
In contrast, hyperthyroidism‚Äîan abnormally elevated blood level of thyroid hormones‚Äîis often caused by a pituitary or thyroid tumor.
In Graves‚Äô disease, the hyperthyroid state results fromanautoimmunereactioninwhichantibodiesoverstimulatethefolliclecellsofthethyroidgland.Hyperthyroidism canleadtoanincreasedmetabolicrate,excessivebodyheatandsweating,diarrhea,weightloss,tremors,andincreased heart rate.
The person‚Äôs eyes may bulge (called exophthalmos) as antibodies produce inflammation in the soft tissues of the orbits.
The person may also develop a goiter.
Calcitonin The thyroid gland also secretes a hormone called calcitonin that is produced by the parafollicular cells (also called C cells) that stud the tissue between distinct follicles.
Calcitonin is released in response to a rise in blood calcium levels.
It appears to have a function in decreasing blood calcium concentrations by: ‚Ä¢Inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, bone cells that release calcium into the circulation by degrading bone matrix ‚Ä¢Increasing osteoblastic activityCHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 709 ‚Ä¢Decreasing calcium absorption in the intestines ‚Ä¢Increasing calcium loss in the urine However, these functions are usually not significant in maintaining calcium homeostasis, so the importance of calcitonin is not entirely understood.
Pharmaceutical preparations of calcitonin are sometimes prescribed to reduce osteoclast activity in people with osteoporosis and to reduce the degradation of cartilage in people with osteoarthritis.
The hormones secreted by thyroid are summarized in Table 17.4.

The organs involved in the regulation are the parathyroid glands.

A thick connective tissue capsule separates the glands from the thyroid tissue.

TheparathyroidglandsproduceandsecretePTH, apeptidehormone,inresponsetolowbloodcalciumlevels(Figure 17.16).
PTH secretion causes the release of calcium from the bones by stimulating osteoclasts, which secrete enzymes that degrade bone and release calcium into the interstitial fluid.
PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone deposition, thereby sparing blood calcium.
PTH causes increased reabsorption of calcium (and magnesium) in the kidney tubules from the urine filtrate.
In addition, PTH initiates the production of the steroid hormone calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which is the active form of vitamin D 3, in the kidneys.
Calcitriol then stimulates increased absorption of dietary calcium by the intestines.
A negative feedback loop regulates the levels of PTH, with rising blood calcium levels inhibiting further release of PTH.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 711 Figure 17.16 Parathyroid Hormone in Maintaining Blood Calcium Homeostasis Parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium levels when they drop too low.
Conversely, calcitonin, which is released from the thyroid gland, decreases blood calcium levels when they become too high.
These two mechanisms constantly maintain blood calcium concentration at homeostasis.
Abnormally high activity of the parathyroid gland can cause hyperparathyroidism, a disorder caused by an overproduction of PTH that results in excessive calcium reabsorption from bone.
Hyperparathyroidism can significantly decrease bone density, leading to spontaneous fractures or deformities.
As blood calcium levels rise, cell membrane permeability to sodium is decreased, and the responsiveness of the nervous system is reduced.
At the same time, calcium deposits may collect in the body‚Äôs tissues and organs, impairing their functioning.
In contrast, abnormally low blood calcium levels may be caused by parathyroid hormone deficiency, called hypoparathyroidism, which may develop following injury or surgery involving the thyroid gland.
Low blood calcium increases membrane permeability to sodium, resulting in muscle twitching, cramping, spasms, or convulsions.
Severe deficits can paralyze muscles, including those involved in breathing, and can be fatal.

The adrenal glands have a rich blood supply and experience one of the highest rates of blood flow in the body.
They are served by several arteries branching off the aorta, including the suprarenal and renal arteries.
Blood flows to each adrenal gland at the adrenal cortex and then drains into the adrenal medulla.
Adrenal hormones are released into the circulation via the left and right suprarenal veins.
Figure 17.17 Adrenal Glands Both adrenal glands sit atop the kidneys and are composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla, all surrounded by a connective tissue capsule.
The cortex can be subdivided into additional zones, all of which produce different types of hormones.
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) View the University of Michigan WebScope at http://141.214.65.171/Histology/Endocrine%20System/ New%20Scans/230_HISTO_40x.svs/view.apml(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/adrenal) toexplorethetissuesample in greater detail.
The adrenal gland consists of an outer cortex of glandular tissue and an inner medulla of nervous tissue.
The cortex itselfisdividedintothreezones:the zonaglomerulosa,the zonafasciculata,andthe zonareticularis .Eachregionsecretes its own set of hormones.
Theadrenal cortex , as a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, secretes steroid hormones important for the regulation of the long-term stress response, blood pressure and blood volume, nutrient uptake and storage, fluid and electrolyte balance, and inflammation.
The HPA axis involves the stimulation of hormone release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary by the hypothalamus.
ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce the hormone cortisol.
This pathway will be discussed in more detail below .
Theadrenal medulla is neuroendocrine tissue composed of postganglionic sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurons.
It is really an extension of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates homeostasis in the body.
The sympathomedullary (SAM) pathway involves the stimulation of the medulla by impulses from the hypothalamus via neurons from the thoracic spinal cord.
The medulla is stimulated to secrete the amine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 713 One of the major functions of the adrenal gland is to respond to stress.
Stress can be either physical or psychological orboth.Physicalstressesincludeexposingthebodytoinjury,walkingoutsideincoldandwetconditionswithoutacoaton, ormalnutrition.Psychologicalstressesincludetheperceptionofaphysicalthreat,afightwithalovedone,orjustabadday at school.

Stage one of GAS is called the alarm reaction .

The section on the adrenal medulla covers this response in more detail.
If the stress is not soon relieved, the body adapts to the stress in the second stage called the stage of resistance .
If a person is starving for example, the body may send signals to the gastrointestinal tract to maximize the absorption of nutrients from food.
If the stress continues for a longer term however, the body responds with symptoms quite different than the fight- or-flight response.
During the stage of exhaustion , individuals may begin to suffer depression, the suppression of their immuneresponse,severefatigue,orevenafatalheartattack.Thesesymptomsaremediatedbythehormonesoftheadrenal cortex, especially cortisol, released as a result of signals from the HP A axis.
Adrenal hormones also have several non‚Äìstress-related functions, including the increase of blood sodium and glucose levels, which will be described in detail below.
Adrenal Cortex The adrenal cortex consists of multiple layers of lipid-storing cells that occur in three structurally distinct regions.
Each of these regions produces different hormones.
Visitthis link(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/adrenalglands) toviewananimationdescribingthelocationandfunction of the adrenal glands.
Which hormone produced by the adrenal glands is responsible for the mobilization of energy stores?
Hormones of the Zona Glomerulosa Themostsuperficialregionoftheadrenalcortexisthezonaglomerulosa,whichproducesagroupofhormonescollectively referred to as mineralocorticoids because of their effect on body minerals, especially sodium and potassium.
These hormones are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance.
Aldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid.

Its secretion is prompted when CRH from the hypothalamus triggers ACTH release from the anterior pituitary.
Aldosterone is also a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in which specialized cells of the kidneys secrete the enzyme renin in response to low blood volume or low blood pressure.
Renin then catalyzes the conversion of the blood protein angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to the hormone angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted in the lungs to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
Angiotensin II has three major functions: 1.Initiating vasoconstriction of the arterioles, decreasing blood flow 2.Stimulating kidney tubules to reabsorb NaCl and water, increasing blood volume 3.Signaling the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, the effects of which further contribute to fluid retention, restoring blood pressure and blood volume For individualswith hypertension,or high blood pressure, drugs areavailablethatblocktheproductionof angiotensin II.
These drugs, known as ACE inhibitors, block the ACE enzyme from converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thus mitigating the latter‚Äôs ability to increase blood pressure.714 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Hormones of the Zona Fasciculata The intermediate region of the adrenal cortex is the zona fasciculata, named as such because the cells form small fascicles (bundles) separated by tiny blood vessels.
The cells of the zona fasciculata produce hormones called glucocorticoids because of their role in glucose metabolism.
The most important of these is cortisol, some of which the liver converts to cortisone.
A glucocorticoid produced in much smaller amounts is corticosterone.
In response to long-term stressors, the hypothalamus secretes CRH, which in turn triggers the release of ACTH by the anterior pituitary.
ACTH triggers the release of the glucocorticoids.
Their overall effect is to inhibit tissue building while stimulating the breakdown of stored nutrientstomaintainadequatefuelsupplies.Inconditionsoflong-termstress,forexample,cortisolpromotesthecatabolism of glycogen to glucose, the catabolism of stored triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, and the catabolism of muscle proteinsintoaminoacids.Theserawmaterialscanthenbeusedtosynthesizeadditionalglucoseandketonesforuseasbody fuels.
The hippocampus, which is part of the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortices and important in memory formation, is highly sensitive to stress levels because of its many glucocorticoid receptors.
You are probably familiar with prescription and over-the-counter medications containing glucocorticoids, such as cortisone injections into inflamed joints, prednisone tablets and steroid-based inhalers used to manage severe asthma, and hydrocortisonecreamsappliedtorelieveitchyskinrashes.Thesedrugsreflectanotherroleofcortisol‚Äîthedownregulation of the immune system, which inhibits the inflammatory response.
Hormones of the Zona Reticularis The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex hormones called androgens.
During puberty and most of adulthood, androgens are produced in the gonads.
The androgens produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens.
They are produced in response to ACTH from the anterior pituitary and are converted in the tissues to testosterone or estrogens.
In adult women, they may contribute to the sexdrive,buttheirfunctioninadultmenisnotwellunderstood.Inpost-menopausalwomen,asthefunctionsoftheovaries decline, the main source of estrogens becomes the androgens produced by the zona reticularis.
Adrenal Medulla As noted earlier, the adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids in response to long-term stress such as severe illness.
In contrast, the adrenal medulla releases its hormones in response to acute, short-term stress mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).
The medullary tissue is composed of unique postganglionic SNS neurons called chromaffin cells, which are large and irregularly shaped, and produce the neurotransmitters epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine (or noradrenaline).Epinephrineisproducedingreaterquantities‚Äîapproximatelya4to1ratiowithnorepinephrine‚Äîandisthe morepowerfulhormone.Becausethechromaffincellsreleaseepinephrineandnorepinephrineintothesystemiccirculation, where they travel widely and exert effects on distant cells, they are considered hormones.
Derived from the amino acid tyrosine, they are chemically classified as catecholamines.
The secretion of medullary epinephrine and norepinephrine is controlled by a neural pathway that originates from the hypothalamusinresponsetodangerorstress(theSAMpathway).Bothepinephrineandnorepinephrinesignaltheliverand skeletalmusclecellstoconvertglycogenintoglucose,resultinginincreasedbloodglucoselevels.Thesehormonesincrease the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure to prepare the body to fight the perceived threat or flee from it.
In addition, the pathway dilates the airways, raising blood oxygen levels.
It also prompts vasodilation, further increasing the oxygenation of important organs such as the lungs, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle.
At the same time, it triggers vasoconstriction to blood vessels serving less essential organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skin, and downregulates some components of the immune system.
Other effects include a dry mouth, loss of appetite, pupil dilation, and a loss of peripheral vision.
The major hormones of the adrenal glands are summarized in Table 17.5.

It is caused by hypersecretion of cortisol.
The most common source of Cushing‚Äôs disease is a pituitary tumor that secretesCHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 715 cortisol or ACTH in abnormally high amounts.
Other common signs of Cushing‚Äôs disease include the development of a moon-shaped face, a buffalo hump on the back of the neck, rapid weight gain, and hair loss.
Chronically elevated glucose levels are also associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
In addition to hyperglycemia, chronically elevated glucocorticoids compromise immunity, resistance to infection, and memory, and can result in rapid weight gain and hair loss.
In contrast, the hyposecretion of corticosteroids can result in Addison‚Äôs disease, a rare disorder that causes low blood glucoselevelsandlowbloodsodiumlevels.ThesignsandsymptomsofAddison‚Äôsdiseasearevagueandaretypicalofother disorders as well, making diagnosis difficult.
They may include general weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and cravings for salty food.
17.7|The Pineal Gland By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the location and structure of the pineal gland ‚Ä¢Discuss the function of melatonin Recall that the hypothalamus, part of the diencephalon of the brain, sits inferior and somewhat anterior to the thalamus.

As a result, blood levels of melatonin fall, promoting wakefulness.
In contrast, as light levels decline‚Äîsuch as during the evening‚Äîmelatonin production increases, boosting blood levels and causing drowsiness.
Visit this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/melatonin) to view an animation describing the function of the hormone melatonin.
What should you avoid doing in the middle of your sleep cycle that would lower melatonin?
The secretion of melatonin may influence the body‚Äôs circadian rhythms, the dark-light fluctuations that affect not only sleepiness and wakefulness, but also appetite and body temperature.
Interestingly, children have higher melatonin levels than adults, which may prevent the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary, thereby inhibiting the onset of puberty.
Finally, an antioxidant role of melatonin is the subject of current research.
Jet lag occurs when a person travels across several time zones and feels sleepy during the day or wakeful at night.
Traveling across multiple time zones significantly disturbs the light-dark cycle regulated by melatonin.
It can take up to several days for melatonin synthesis to adjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment, resulting in jet lag.
Some air travelers take melatonin supplements to induce sleep.
17.8|Gonadal and Placental Hormones By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the most important hormones produced by the testes and ovaries ‚Ä¢Name the hormones produced by the placenta and state their functions716 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Thissectionbrieflydiscussesthehormonalroleofthegonads‚Äîthemaletestesandfemaleovaries‚Äîwhichproducethesex cells(spermandova)andsecretethegonadalhormones.Therolesofthegonadotropinsreleasedfromtheanteriorpituitary (FSH and LH) were discussed earlier.

In addition, the testes produce the peptide hormone inhibin, which inhibits the secretion of FSH from the anterior pituitary gland.
FSH stimulates spermatogenesis.
The primary hormones produced by the ovaries are estrogens, which include estradiol, estriol, and estrone.
Estrogens play an important role in a larger number of physiological processes, including the development of the female reproductive system, regulation of the menstrual cycle, the development of female secondary sex characteristics such as increased adiposetissueandthedevelopmentofbreasttissue,andthemaintenanceofpregnancy.Anothersignificantovarianhormone isprogesterone,whichcontributestoregulationofthemenstrualcycleandisimportantinpreparingthebodyforpregnancy as well as maintaining pregnancy.
In addition, the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles produce inhibin, which‚Äîas in males‚Äîinhibits the secretion of FSH.During the initial stages of pregnancy, an organ called the placenta develops within the uterus.
The placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, excretes waste products, and produces and secretes estrogens and progesterone.
The placenta produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as well.
The hCG hormone promotes progesterone synthesis and reduces the mother‚Äôs immune function to protect the fetus from immune rejection.
It alsosecreteshumanplacentallactogen(hPL),whichplaysaroleinpreparingthebreastsforlactation,andrelaxin,whichis thought to help soften and widen the pubic symphysis in preparation for childbirth.

A prominent example of this is the use of steroid drugs by professional athletes.

The use of performance-enhancing drugs is banned by all major collegiate and professional sports organizations in the United States because they impart an unfair advantage to athletes who take them.
In addition, the drugs can cause significant and dangerous side effects.
For example, anabolic steroid use can increase cholesterol levels, raise blood pressure, and damage the liver.
Altered testosterone levels (both too low or too high) have been implicated in causing structural damage to the heart, and increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and sudden death.

Figure 17.18 Pancreas The pancreatic exocrine function involves the acinar cells secreting digestive enzymes that are transported into the small intestine by the pancreatic duct.
Its endocrine function involves the secretion of insulin (produced by beta cells) and glucagon (produced by alpha cells) within the pancreatic islets.
These two hormones regulate the rate of glucose metabolism in the body.
The micrograph reveals pancreatic islets.

Cells and Secretions of the Pancreatic Islets The pancreatic islets each contain four varieties of cells: ‚Ä¢Thealpha cell produces the hormone glucagon and makes up approximately 20 percent of each islet.
Glucagon plays an important role in blood glucose regulation; low blood glucose levels stimulate its release.
‚Ä¢Thebeta cell produces the hormone insulin and makes up approximately 75 percent of each islet.
Elevated blood glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin.718 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 ‚Ä¢Thedelta cell accounts for four percent of the islet cells and secretes the peptide hormone somatostatin.
Recall that somatostatin is also released by the hypothalamus (as GHIH), and the stomach and intestines also secrete it.
An inhibiting hormone, pancreatic somatostatin inhibits the release of both glucagon and insulin.
‚Ä¢ThePPcellaccountsforaboutonepercentofisletcellsandsecretesthepancreaticpolypeptidehormone.Itisthought to play a role in appetite, as well as in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine secretions.
Pancreatic polypeptide released following a meal may reduce further food consumption; however, it is also released in response to fasting.
Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon Glucose is required for cellular respiration and is the preferred fuel for all body cells.
The body derives glucose from the breakdownofthecarbohydrate-containingfoodsanddrinksweconsume.Glucosenotimmediatelytakenupbycellsforfuel canbestoredbytheliverandmusclesasglycogen,orconvertedtotriglyceridesandstoredintheadiposetissue.Hormones regulate both the storage and the utilization of glucose as required.
Receptors located in the pancreas sense blood glucose levels, and subsequently the pancreatic cells secrete glucagon or insulin to maintain normal levels.
Glucagon Receptors in the pancreas can sense the decline in blood glucose levels, such as during periods of fasting or during prolonged labor or exercise (Figure 17.19).
In response, the alpha cells of the pancreas secrete the hormone glucagon, which has several effects: ‚Ä¢It stimulates the liver to convert its stores of glycogen back into glucose.
This response is known as glycogenolysis.
The glucose is then released into the circulation for use by body cells.
‚Ä¢Itstimulatesthelivertotakeupaminoacidsfromthebloodandconvertthemintoglucose.Thisresponseisknownas gluconeogenesis.
‚Ä¢Itstimulateslipolysis,thebreakdownofstoredtriglyceridesintofreefattyacidsandglycerol.Someofthefreeglycerol releasedintothebloodstreamtravelstotheliver,whichconvertsitintoglucose.Thisisalsoaformofgluconeogenesis.
Taken together, these actions increase blood glucose levels.
The activity of glucagon is regulated through a negative feedback mechanism; rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon production and secretion.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 719 Figure 17.19 Homeostatic Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels Blood glucose concentration is tightly maintained between 70 mg/dL and 110 mg/dL.
If blood glucose concentration rises above this range, insulin is released, which stimulates body cells to remove glucose from the blood.
If blood glucose concentration drops below this range, glucagon is released, which stimulates body cells to release glucose into the blood.
Insulin The primary function of insulinis to facilitate the uptake of glucose into body cells.
Red blood cells, as well as cells of the brain, liver, kidneys, and the lining of the small intestine, do not have insulin receptors on their cell membranes and do not require insulin for glucose uptake.
Although all other body cells do require insulin if they are to take glucose from the bloodstream, skeletal muscle cells and adipose cells are the primary tar gets of insulin.720 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The presence of food in the intestine triggers the release of gastrointestinal tract hormones such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (previously known as gastric inhibitory peptide).
This is in turn the initial trigger for insulin production and secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas.
Once nutrient absorption occurs, the resulting surge in blood glucose levels further stimulates insulin secretion.
Precisely how insulin facilitates glucose uptake is not entirely clear.
However, insulin appears to activate a tyrosine kinase receptor, triggering the phosphorylation of many substrates within the cell.
These multiple biochemical reactions convergetosupportthemovementofintracellularvesiclescontainingfacilitativeglucosetransporterstothecellmembrane.
Intheabsenceofinsulin,thesetransportproteinsarenormallyrecycledslowlybetweenthecellmembraneandcellinterior.
Insulin triggers the rapid movement of a pool of glucose transporter vesicles to the cell membrane, where they fuse and expose the glucose transporters to the extracellular fluid.
The transporters then move glucose by facilitated diffusion into the cell interior.

What goes wrong in the function of insulin in type 2 diabetes?
Insulin also reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating glycolysis, the metabolism of glucose for generation of ATP.
Moreover, it stimulates the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage, and it inhibits enzymes involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
Finally, insulin promotes triglyceride and protein synthesis.
The secretion of insulin is regulated through a negative feedback mechanism.
As blood glucose levels decrease, further insulin release is inhibited.
The pancreatic hormones are summarized in Table 17.7.
Hormones of the Pancreas Associated hormones Chemical class Effect Insulin (beta cells) Protein Reduces blood glucose levels Glucagon (alpha cells) Protein Increases blood glucose levels Somatostatin (delta cells) Protein Inhibits insulin and glucagon release Pancreatic polypeptide (PP cells) Protein Role in appetite Table 17.7CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 721 Endocrine System: Diabetes Mellitus Dysfunction of insulin production and secretion, as well as the target cells‚Äô responsiveness to insulin, can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus.
An increasingly common disease, diabetes mellitus has been diagnosed in more than 18 million adults in the United States, and more than 200,000 children.
It is estimated that up to 7 million more adults have the condition but have not been diagnosed.
In addition, approximately 79 million people in the US are estimatedtohavepre-diabetes,aconditioninwhichbloodglucoselevelsareabnormallyhigh,butnotyethighenough to be classified as diabetes.
There are two main forms of diabetes mellitus.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease affecting the beta cells of the pancreas.
Certain genes are recognized to increase susceptibility.
The beta cells of people with type 1 diabetes do not produce insulin; thus, synthetic insulin must be administered by injection or infusion.
This form of diabetes accounts for less than five percent of all diabetes cases.
Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 95 percent of all cases.
It is acquired, and lifestyle factors such as poordiet,inactivity,andthepresenceofpre-diabetesgreatlyincreaseaperson‚Äôsrisk.About80to90percentofpeople with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.
In type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to the effects of insulin.
In response, the pancreas increases its insulin secretion, but over time, the beta cells become exhausted.
In many cases, type 2 diabetes can be reversed by moderate weight loss, regular physical activity, and consumption of a healthy diet; however, if blood glucose levels cannot be controlled, the diabetic will eventually require insulin.
Twooftheearlymanifestationsofdiabetesareexcessiveurinationandexcessivethirst.Theydemonstratehowthe out-of-control levels of glucose in the blood affect kidney function.
The kidneys are responsible for filtering glucose fromtheblood.Excessivebloodglucosedrawswaterintotheurine,andasaresultthepersoneliminatesanabnormally largequantityofsweeturine.Theuseofbodywatertodilutetheurineleavesthebodydehydrated,andsothepersonis unusually and continually thirsty.
The person may also experience persistent hunger because the body cells are unable to access the glucose in the bloodstream.
Over time, persistently high levels of glucose in the blood injure tissues throughout the body, especially those of the blood vessels and nerves.
Inflammation and injury of the lining of arteries lead to atherosclerosis and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
Damage to the microscopic blood vessels of the kidney impairs kidney function and can lead to kidney failure.
Damage to blood vessels that serve the eyes can lead to blindness.
Blood vessel damage alsoreducescirculationtothelimbs,whereasnervedamageleadstoalossofsensation,calledneuropathy,particularly in the hands and feet.
Together, these changes increase the risk of injury, infection, and tissue death (necrosis), contributing to a high rate of toe, foot, and lower leg amputations in people with diabetes.
Uncontrolled diabetes can also lead to a dangerous form of metabolic acidosis called ketoacidosis.
Deprived of glucose, cells increasingly rely on fat stores for fuel.
However, in a glucose-deficient state, the liver is forced to use an alternative lipid metabolism pathway that results in the increased production of ketone bodies (or ketones), which are acidic.
The build-up of ketones in the blood causes ketoacidosis, which‚Äîif left untreated‚Äîmay lead to a life-threatening ‚Äúdiabetic coma.‚Äù Together, these complications make diabetes the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.
Diabetes is diagnosed when lab tests reveal that blood glucose levels are higher than normal, a condition called hyperglycemia .
The treatment of diabetes depends on the type, the severity of the condition, and the ability of the patient to make lifestyle changes.
As noted earlier, moderate weight loss, regular physical activity, and consumption of a healthful diet can reduce blood glucose levels.
Some patients with type 2 diabetes may be unable to control their diseasewiththeselifestylechanges,andwillrequiremedication.Historically,thefirst-linetreatmentoftype2diabetes was insulin.
Research advances have resulted in alternative options, including medications that enhance pancreatic function.722 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Visit this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/insulin) to view an animation describing the role of insulin and the pancreas in diabetes.
17.10|Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the organs with a secondary endocrine function, the hormone they produce, and its effects In your study of anatomy and physiology, you have already encountered a few of the many organs of the body that have secondary endocrine functions.
Here, you will learn about the hormone-producing activities of the heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, skeleton, adipose tissue, skin, and thymus.
Heart When the body experiences an increase in blood volume or pressure, the cells of the heart‚Äôs atrial wall stretch.
In response, specialized cells in the wall of the atria produce and secrete the peptide hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).
ANP signalsthekidneystoreducesodiumreabsorption,therebydecreasingtheamountofwaterreabsorbedfromtheurinefiltrate and reducing blood volume.
Other actions of ANP include the inhibition of renin secretion and the initiation of the renin- angiotensin-aldosteronesystem(RAAS)andvasodilation.Therefore,ANPaidsindecreasingbloodpressure,bloodvolume, and blood sodium levels.
Gastrointestinal Tract The endocrine cells of the GI tract are located in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine.
Some of these hormones are secreted in response to eating a meal and aid in digestion.
An example of a hormone secreted by the stomach cells is gastrin, a peptide hormone secreted in response to stomach distention that stimulates the release of hydrochloric acid.
Secretinisapeptidehormonesecretedbythesmallintestineasacidicchyme(partiallydigestedfoodandfluid)movesfrom the stomach.
It stimulates the release of bicarbonate from the pancreas, which buffers the acidic chyme, and inhibits the furthersecretionofhydrochloricacidbythestomach.Cholecystokinin(CCK)isanotherpeptidehormonereleasedfromthe small intestine.
It promotes the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and the release of bile from the gallbladder, both of which facilitate digestion.
Other hormones produced by the intestinal cells aid in glucose metabolism, such as by stimulating the pancreaticbetacellstosecreteinsulin,reducingglucagonsecretionfromthealphacells,orenhancingcellularsensitivityto insulin.
Kidneys The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones.
A decline in blood flow to the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, and stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water.
The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure.
The kidneys also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D 3, which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).
In addition, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO)in response to low oxygen levels.
EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues.
You may have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a synthetic form).
Skeleton Although bone has long been recognized as a target for hormones, only recently have researchers recognized that the skeleton itself produces at least two hormones.
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is produced by bone cells in responseCHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 723 to increased blood levels of vitamin D 3or phosphate.
It triggers the kidneys to inhibit the formation of calcitriol from vitamin D 3and to increase phosphorus excretion.
Osteocalcin, produced by osteoblasts, stimulates the pancreatic beta cells to increaseinsulinproduction.It also acts on peripheraltissues to increasetheirsensitivityto insulinand theirutilizationof glucose.
Adipose Tissue Adiposetissueproducesandsecretesseveralhormonesinvolvedinlipidmetabolismandstorage.Oneimportantexampleis leptin, a protein manufactured by adipose cells that circulates in amounts directly proportional to levels of body fat.
Leptin isreleasedinresponsetofoodconsumptionandactsbybindingtobrainneuronsinvolvedinenergyintakeandexpenditure.
Binding of leptin produces a feeling of satiety after a meal, thereby reducing appetite.
It also appears that the binding of leptin to brain receptors triggers the sympathetic nervous system to regulate bone metabolism, increasing deposition of cortical bone.
Adiponectin‚Äîanother hormone synthesized by adipose cells‚Äîappears to reduce cellular insulin resistance and to protect blood vessels from inflammation and atherosclerosis.
Its levels are lower in people who are obese, and rise following weight loss.
Skin The skin functions as an endocrine organ in the production of the inactive form of vitamin D 3, cholecalciferol.
When cholesterol present in the epidermis is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, it is converted to cholecalciferol, which then enters the blood.
In the liver, cholecalciferol is converted to an intermediate that travels to the kidneys and is further converted to calcitriol,theactiveformofvitaminD 3.VitaminDisimportantinavarietyofphysiologicalprocesses,includingintestinal calcium absorption and immune system function.
In some studies, low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased risks of cancer, severe asthma, and multiple sclerosis.
Vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets, and in adults, osteomalacia‚Äîboth of which are characterized by bone deterioration.
Thymus Thethymusisanorganoftheimmunesystemthatislargerandmoreactiveduringinfancyandearlychildhood,andbegins to atrophy as we age.
Its endocrine function is the production of a group of hormones called thymosins that contribute to the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes, which are immune cells.
Although the role of thymosins is not yet well understood, it is clear that they contribute to the immune response.
Thymosins have been found in tissues other than the thymus and have a wide variety of functions, so the thymosins cannot be strictly categorized as thymic hormones.
Liver The liver is responsible for secreting at least four important hormones or hormone precursors: insulin-like growth factor (somatomedin), angiotensinogen, thrombopoetin, and hepcidin.
Insulin-like growth factor-1 is the immediate stimulus for growth in the body, especially of the bones.
Angiotensinogen is the precursor to angiotensin, mentioned earlier, which increases blood pressure.
Thrombopoetin stimulates the production of the blood‚Äôs platelets.
Hepcidins block the release of iron from cells in the body, helping to regulate iron homeostasis in our body fluids.
The major hormones of these other organs are summarized in Table 17.8.

The pituitary gland arises from two distinct areas of the ectoderm: the anterior pituitary gland arises from the oral ectoderm, whereas the posterior pituitary gland arises from the neural ectoderm at the base of the hypothalamus.
The pineal gland also arises from the ectoderm.
The two structures of the adrenal glands arise from two different germ layers: the adrenal cortex from the mesoderm and the adrenal medulla from ectoderm neural cells.
The endoderm gives rise to the thyroid and parathyroid glands, as well as the pancreas and the thymus.
As the body ages, changes occur that affect the endocrine system, sometimes altering the production, secretion, and catabolismof hormones.
For example,the structure of the anterior pituitarygland changes as vascularizationdecreases and the connective tissue content increases with increasing age.
This restructuring affects the gland‚Äôs hormone production.
For example, the amount of human growth hormone that is produced declines with age, resulting in the reduced muscle mass commonly observed in the elderly.
The adrenal glands also undergo changes as the body ages; as fibrous tissue increases, the production of cortisol and aldosterone decreases.
Interestingly, the production and secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine remain normal throughout the aging process.
A well-known example of the aging process affecting an endocrine gland is menopause and the decline of ovarian function.
With increasing age, the ovaries decrease in both size and weight and become progressively less sensitive to gonadotropins.Thisgraduallycausesadecreaseinestrogenandprogesteronelevels,leadingtomenopauseandtheinability to reproduce.
Low levels of estrogens and progesterone are also associated with some disease states, such as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia, or abnormal blood lipid levels.
Testosterone levels also decline with age, a condition called andropause (or viropause); however, this decline is much less dramatic than the decline of estrogens in women, and much more gradual, rarely affecting sperm production until very old age.
Although this means that males maintain their ability to father children for decades longer than females, the quantity, quality, and motility of their sperm is often reduced.
As the body ages, the thyroid gland produces less of the thyroid hormones, causing a gradual decrease in the basal metabolic rate.
The lower metabolic rate reduces the production of body heat and increases levels of body fat.
Parathyroid hormones, on the other hand, increase with age.
This may be because of reduced dietary calcium levels, causing a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone.
However, increased parathyroid hormone levels combined with decreasedCHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 725 levels of calcitonin (and estrogens in women) can lead to osteoporosis as PTH stimulates demineralization of bones to increase blood calcium levels.
Notice that osteoporosis is common in both elderly males and females.
Increasingagealsoaffectsglucosemetabolism,asbloodglucoselevelsspikemorerapidlyandtakelongertoreturnto normal in the elderly.
In addition, increasing glucose intolerance may occur because of a gradual decline in cellular insulin sensitivity.
Almost 27 percent of Americans aged 65 and older have diabetes.726 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 acromegaly adenylyl cyclase adrenal cortex adrenal glands adrenal medulla adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) alarm reaction aldosterone alpha cell angiotensin-converting enzyme antidiuretic hormone (ADH) atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) autocrine beta cell calcitonin chromaffin colloid cortisol cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) delta cell diabetes mellitus diacylglycerol (DAG) downregulationKEY TERMS disorder in adults caused when abnormally high levels of GH trigger growth of bones in the face, hands, and feet membrane-boundenzymethatconvertsATPtocyclicAMP,creatingcAMP,asaresultofG-protein activation outer region of the adrenal glands consisting of multiple layers of epithelial cells and capillary networks that produces mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids endocrine glands located at the top of each kidney that are important for the regulation of the stress response, blood pressure and blood volume, water homeostasis, and electrolyte levels inner layer of the adrenal glands that plays an important role in the stress response by producing epinephrine and norepinephrine anterior pituitary hormone that stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete corticosteroid hormones (also called corticotropin) the short-term stress, or the fight-or-flight response, of stage one of the general adaptation syndrome mediated by the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine hormone produced and secreted by the adrenal cortex that stimulates sodium and fluid retention and increases blood volume and blood pressure pancreatic islet cell type that produces the hormone glucagon the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II hypothalamic hormone that is stored by the posterior pituitary and that signals the kidneys to reabsorb water peptide hormone produced by the walls of the atria in response to high blood pressure, blood volume, or blood sodium that reduces the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys and promotes vasodilation chemical signal that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it pancreatic islet cell type that produces the hormone insulin peptide hormone produced and secreted by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland that functions to decrease blood calcium levels neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla viscous fluid in the central cavity of thyroid follicles, containing the glycoprotein thyroglobulin glucocorticoid important in gluconeogenesis, the catabolism of glycogen, and downregulation of the immune system second messenger that, in response to adenylyl cyclase activation, triggers a phosphorylation cascade minor cell type in the pancreas that secretes the hormone somatostatin conditioncausedbydestructionordysfunctionofthebetacellsofthepancreasorcellularresistance to insulin that results in abnormally high blood glucose levels molecule that, like cAMP, activates protein kinases, thereby initiating a phosphorylation cascade decreaseinthenumberofhormonereceptors,typicallyinresponsetochronicallyexcessivelevelsof a hormoneCHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 727 endocrine gland endocrine system epinephrine erythropoietin (EPO) estrogens exocrine system first messenger follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) G protein general adaptation syndrome (GAS) gigantism glucagon glucocorticoids goiter gonadotropins growth hormone (GH) hormone receptor hormone hyperglycemia hyperparathyroidism hyperthyroidism hypoparathyroidism hypophyseal portal system hypothalamus hypothyroidism infundibulumtissueororganthatsecreteshormonesintothebloodandlymphwithoutductssuchthattheymaybe transported to organs distant from the site of secretion cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function and play an integral role in normal bodily processes primary and most potent catecholamine hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla in response to short- term stress;

The body coordinatesitsfunctionsthroughtwomajortypesofcommunication:neuralandendocrine.Neuralcommunicationincludes both electrical and chemical signaling between neurons and target cells.
Endocrine communication involves chemical signaling via the release of hormones into the extracellular fluid.
From there, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and may travel to distant body regions, where they elicit a response in target cells.
Endocrine glands are ductless glands that secrete hormones.
Many organs of the body with other primary functions‚Äîsuch as the heart, stomach, and kidneys‚Äîalso have hormone-secreting cells.
17.2 Hormones Hormones are derived from amino acids or lipids.
Amine hormones originate from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine.
Larger amino acid hormones include peptides and protein hormones.
Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol.
Steroid hormones and thyroid hormone are lipid soluble.
All other amino acid‚Äìderived hormones are water soluble.
Hydrophobic hormones are able to diffuse through the membrane and interact with an intracellular receptor.
In contrast, hydrophilic hormones must interact with cell membrane receptors.
These are typically associated with a G protein, which becomesactivatedwhenthehormonebindsthereceptor.Thisinitiatesasignalingcascadethatinvolvesasecondmessenger, such as cyclicadenosinemonophosphate(cAMP).
Second messenger systems greatlyamplifythe hormone signal, creating a broader, more efficient, and faster response.
Hormones are released upon stimulation that is of either chemical or neural origin.
Regulation of hormone release is primarilyachievedthroughnegativefeedback.Variousstimulimaycausethereleaseofhormones,buttherearethreemajor730 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 types.
Humoral stimuli are changes in ion or nutrient levels in the blood.
Hormonal stimuli are changes in hormone levels thatinitiateorinhibitthesecretionofanotherhormone.Finally,aneuralstimulusoccurswhenanerveimpulsepromptsthe secretion or inhibition of a hormone.
17.3 The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus The hypothalamus‚Äìpituitary complex is located in the diencephalon of the brain.
The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are connected by a structure called the infundibulum, which contains vasculature and nerve axons.
The pituitary gland is divided into two distinct structures with different embryonic origins.
The posterior lobe houses the axon terminals of hypothalamic neurons.
It stores and releases into the bloodstream two hypothalamic hormones: oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
The anterior lobe is connected to the hypothalamus by vasculature in the infundibulum and produces and secretes six hormones.
Their secretion is regulated, however, by releasing and inhibiting hormones from the hypothalamus.
The six anterior pituitary hormones are: growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL).
17.4 The Thyroid Gland The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the neck anterior to the trachea.
Its hormones regulate basal metabolism, oxygen use, nutrient metabolism, the production of ATP, and calcium homeostasis.
They also contribute to protein synthesis and the normal growth and development of body tissues, including maturation of the nervous system, and they increase the body‚Äôs sensitivity to catecholamines.
The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) are produced and secreted by the thyroid gland in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary.
Synthesisoftheaminoacid‚ÄìderivedT 3andT4hormonesrequiresiodine.Insufficientamountsofiodineinthedietcanlead to goiter, cretinism, and many other disorders.
17.5 The Parathyroid Glands Calcium is required for a variety of important physiologic processes, including neuromuscular functioning; thus, blood calcium levels are closely regulated.
The parathyroid glands are small structures located on the posterior thyroid gland that produceparathyroidhormone(PTH),whichregulatesbloodcalciumlevels.Lowbloodcalciumlevelscausetheproduction andsecretionofPTH.Incontrast,elevatedbloodcalciumlevelsinhibitsecretionofPTHandtriggersecretionofthethyroid hormone calcitonin.
Underproduction of PTH can result in hypoparathyroidism.
In contrast, overproduction of PTH can result in hyperparathyroidism.
17.6 The Adrenal Glands The adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney, consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla.
The adrenal cortex‚Äîthe outer layer of the gland‚Äîproduces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens.
The adrenal medulla at the core of the gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.
The adrenal glands mediate a short-term stress response and a long-term stress response.
A perceived threat results in the secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which mediate the fight-or-flight response.
The long-term stress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in turn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex.
The mineralocorticoids, chiefly aldosterone, cause sodium and fluid retention, which increases blood volume and blood pressure.
17.7 The Pineal Gland The pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the diencephalon of the brain, and is located inferior and posterior to the thalamus.
It is made up of pinealocytes.
These cells produce and secrete the hormone melatonin in response to low light levels.
High blood levels of melatonin induce drowsiness.
Jet lag, caused by traveling across several time zones, occurs because melatonin synthesis takes several days to readjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment.
17.8 Gonadal and Placental Hormones The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.Inmales,FSHstimulatesspermmaturation,whichisinhibitedbythehormoneinhibin.Thesteroidhormone testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of the male reproductive system, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics.
In females, FSH promotes egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone.
Both of these hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining pregnancy.
The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the pregnancy.CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 731 17.9 The Endocrine Pancreas The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions.
The pancreatic islet cell types include alpha cells, which produce glucagon;betacells,whichproduceinsulin;deltacells,whichproducesomatostatin;andPPcells,whichproducepancreatic polypeptide.Insulinandglucagonareinvolvedintheregulationofglucosemetabolism.Insulinisproducedbythebetacells in response to high blood glucose levels.
It enhances glucose uptake and utilization by target cells, as well as the storage of excessglucoseforlateruse.Dysfunctionoftheproductionofinsulinortargetcellresistancetotheeffectsofinsulincauses diabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels.
The hormone glucagon is produced and secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels.
Glucagon stimulates mechanisms that increase blood glucose levels, such as the catabolism of glycogen into glucose.
17.10 Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions Some organs have a secondary endocrine function.
For example, the walls of the atria of the heart produce the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the gastrointestinal tract produces the hormones gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin, which aid in digestion, and the kidneys produce erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the formation of red blood cells.
Even bone, adipose tissue, and the skin have secondary endocrine functions.
17.11 Development and Aging of the Endocrine System The endocrine system originates from all three germ layers of the embryo, including the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm.
In general, different hormone classes arise from distinct germ layers.
Aging affects the endocrine glands, potentiallyaffectinghormoneproductionandsecretion,andcancausedisease.Theproductionofhormones,suchashuman growth hormone, cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones, and the thyroid hormones, decreases with age.

18.1|An Overview of Blood By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the primary functions of blood in transportation, defense, and maintenance of homeostasis ‚Ä¢Name the fluid component of blood and the three major types of formed elements, and identify their relative proportions in a blood sample ‚Ä¢Discuss the unique physical characteristics of blood ‚Ä¢Identify the composition of blood plasma, including its most important solutes and plasma proteins Recall that bloodis a connective tissue.
Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an extracellular matrix.
The cellular elements‚Äîreferred to as the formed elements‚Äîinclude red blood cells (RBCs) ,white blood cells (WBCs) , and cell fragments called platelets.
The extracellular matrix, called plasma, makes blood unique among connective tissues because it is fluid.
This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.
Functions of Blood The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is only the beginning of the story.
The specific functions of blood also include defense, distribution of heat, and maintenance of homeostasis.
Transportation Nutrients from the foods you eat are absorbed in the digestive tract.
Most of these travel in the bloodstream directly to the liver, where they are processed and released back into the bloodstream for delivery to body cells.
Oxygen from the air you breathe diffuses into the blood, which moves from the lungs to the heart, which then pumps it out to the rest of the body.
Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body release their products, called hormones, into the bloodstream, whichcarriesthemtodistanttargetcells.Bloodalsopicksupcellularwastesandbyproducts,andtransportsthemtovarious organs for removal.
For instance, blood moves carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation from the body, and various waste products are transported to the kidneys and liver for excretion from the body in the form of urine or bile.
Defense Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have entered the bloodstream in a wound.
Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with mutated DNA that could multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses.
When damage to the vessels results in bleeding, blood platelets and certain proteins dissolved in the plasma, the fluid portion of the blood, interact to block the ruptured areas of the blood vessels involved.
This protects the body from further blood loss.
Maintenance of Homeostasis Recall that body temperature is regulated via a classic negative-feedback loop.
If you were exercising on a warm day, your rising core body temperature would trigger several homeostatic mechanisms, including increased transport of blood from your core to your body periphery, which is typically cooler.
As blood passes through the vessels of the skin, heat would be dissipated to the environment, and the blood returning to your body core would be cooler.
In contrast, on a cold day, blood is diverted away from the skin to maintain a warmer body core.
In extreme cases, this may result in frostbite.
Blood also helps to maintain the chemical balance of the body.
Proteins and other compounds in blood act as buffers, which thereby help to regulate the pH of body tissues.
Blood also helps to regulate the water content of body cells.
Composition of Blood Youhaveprobablyhadblooddrawnfromasuperficialveininyourarm,whichwasthensenttoalabforanalysis.Someof themostcommonbloodtests‚Äîforinstance,thosemeasuringlipidorglucoselevelsinplasma‚Äîdeterminewhichsubstances are present within blood and in what quantities.
Other blood tests check for the composition of the blood itself, including the quantities and types of formed elements.
One such test, called a hematocrit, measures the percentage of RBCs, clinically known as erythrocytes, in a blood sample.Itisperformedbyspinningthebloodsampleinaspecializedcentrifuge,aprocessthatcausestheheavierelements738 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 suspended within the blood sample to separate from the lightweight, liquid plasma (Figure 18.2).
Because the heaviest elementsinbloodaretheerythrocytes,thesesettleattheverybottomofthehematocrittube.Locatedabovetheerythrocytes is a pale, thin layer composed of the remaining formed elements of blood.
These are the WBCs, clinically known as leukocytes, and the platelets, cell fragments also called thrombocytes.
This layer is referred to as the buffy coat because of its color; it normally constitutes less than 1 percent of a blood sample.
Above the buffy coat is the blood plasma, normally a pale, straw-colored fluid, which constitutes the remainder of the sample.
Thevolumeoferythrocytesaftercentrifugationisalsocommonlyreferredtoas packedcellvolume(PCV).Innormal blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes.
The hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly, however, about 36‚Äì50 percent, according to gender and other factors.
Normal hematocrit values for females range from 37 to 47, with a mean value of 41; for males, hematocrit ranges from 42 to 52, with a mean of 47.
The percentage of other formed elements, the WBCs and platelets, is extremely small so it is not normally considered with the hematocrit.
So the mean plasmapercentageisthepercentofbloodthatisnoterythrocytes:forfemales,itisapproximately59(or100minus41),and for males, it is approximately 53 (or 100 minus 47).
Figure 18.2 Composition of Blood The cellular elements of blood include a vast number of erythrocytes and comparatively fewer leukocytes and platelets.
Plasma is the fluid in which the formed elements are suspended.
A sample of blood spun in a centrifuge reveals that plasma is the lightest component.
It floats at the top of the tube separated from the heaviest elements, the erythrocytes, by a buffy coat of leukocytes and platelets.
Hematocrit is the percentage of the total sample that is comprised of erythrocytes.
Depressed and elevated hematocrit levels are shown for comparison.
Characteristics of Blood When you think about blood, the first characteristic that probably comes to mind is its color.
Blood that has just taken up oxygen in the lungs is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a more dusky red.
This is because hemoglobin is a pigment that changes color, depending upon the degree of oxygen saturation.
Blood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch.
It has a viscosity approximately five times greater than water.
Viscosity is a measure of a fluid‚Äôs thickness or resistance to flow, and is influenced by the presence of the plasma proteins and formed elements within the blood.
The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and flow.
Consider the difference in flow between water and honey.
The more viscous honey would demonstrate a greater resistance to flow than the less viscous water.
The same principle applies to blood.
The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperature‚Äîabout 38 ¬∞C (or 100.4 ¬∞F), compared to 37 ¬∞C (or 98.6 ¬∞F) for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations of 0.5 ¬∞C are normal.
Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively smooth, as blood flows through them, it experiences some friction and resistance, especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity, thereby producing heat.
This accounts for its slightly higher temperature.
The pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person.
Blood is therefore somewhat more basic (alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0.
Blood contains numerous buffers that actually help to regulate pH.
Blood constitutes approximately 8 percent of adult body weight.
Adult males typically average about 5 to 6 liters of blood.
Females average 4‚Äì5 liters.
Blood Plasma Like other fluids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of water: In fact, it is about 92 percent water.
Dissolved or suspended within this water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins.
There are literally hundreds of substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma, although many of them are found only in very small quantities.CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 739 Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/normallevels) for a list of normal levels established for many of the substances found in a sample of blood.
Serum, one of the specimen types included, refers to a sample of plasma after clotting factors have been removed.
What types of measurements are given for levels of oxygen in the blood?
Plasma Proteins About 7 percent of the volume of plasma‚Äînearly all that is not water‚Äîis made of proteins.
These include several plasma proteins(proteinsthatareuniquetotheplasma),plusamuchsmallernumberofregulatoryproteins,includingenzymesand some hormones.
The major components of plasma are summarized in Figure 18.3 .
The three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows: ‚Ä¢Albumin is the most abundant of the plasma proteins.
Manufactured by the liver, albumin molecules serve as binding proteins‚Äîtransport vehicles for fatty acids and steroid hormones.
Recall that lipids are hydrophobic; however, their binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma.
Albumin is also the most significant contributor to the osmotic pressure of blood; that is, its presence holds water inside the blood vessels and draws water from the tissues, across blood vessel walls, and into the bloodstream.
This in turn helps to maintain both blood volume and bloodpressure.Albuminnormallyaccountsforapproximately54percentofthetotalplasmaproteincontent,inclinical levels of 3.5‚Äì5.0 g/dL blood.
‚Ä¢The second most common plasma proteins are the globulins.
A heterogeneous group, there are three main subgroups known as alpha, beta, and gamma globulins.
The alpha and beta globulins transport iron, lipids, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K to the cells; like albumin, they also contribute to osmotic pressure.
The gamma globulins are proteins involved in immunity and are better known as an antibodies orimmunoglobulins.
Although other plasma proteins are produced by the liver, immunoglobulins are produced by specialized leukocytes known as plasma cells.
(Seek additional content for more information about immunoglobulins.)
Globulins make up approximately 38 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical levels of 1.0‚Äì1.5 g/dL blood.
‚Ä¢The least abundant plasma protein is fibrinogen.
Like albumin and the alpha and beta globulins, fibrinogen is produced by the liver.
It is essential for blood clotting, a process described later in this chapter.
Fibrinogen accounts for about 7 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical levels of 0.2‚Äì0.45 g/dL blood.
Other Plasma Solutes In addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other substances.
These include various electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen; various organic nutrients,suchasvitamins,lipids,glucose,andaminoacids;andmetabolicwastes.Allofthesenonproteinsolutescombined contribute approximately 1 percent to the total volume of plasma.740 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 18.3 Major Blood ComponentsCHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 741 Phlebotomy and Medical Lab Technology Phlebotomists are professionals trained to draw blood (phleb- = ‚Äúa blood vessel‚Äù; -tomy = ‚Äúto cut‚Äù).
When more than a few drops of blood are required, phlebotomists perform a venipuncture, typically of a surface vein in the arm.
They perform a capillary stick on a finger, an earlobe, or the heel of an infant when only a small quantity of blood is required.
An arterial stick is collected from an artery and used to analyze blood gases.
After collection, the blood may be analyzed by medical laboratories or perhaps used for transfusions, donations, or research.
While many allied health professionals practice phlebotomy, the American Society of Phlebotomy Technicians issues certificates to individuals passing a national examination, and some large labs and hospitals hire individuals expressively for their skill in phlebotomy.
Medical or clinical laboratories employ a variety of individuals in technical positions: ‚Ä¢Medical technologists (MT), also known as clinical laboratory technologists (CLT), typically hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree and certification from an accredited training program.
They perform a wide variety of tests on various body fluids, including blood.
The information they provide is essential to the primary care providers in determining a diagnosis and in monitoring the course of a disease and response to treatment.

18.2|Production of the Formed Elements By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Trace the generation of the formed elements of blood from bone marrow stem cells ‚Ä¢Discuss the role of hemopoietic growth factors in promoting the production of the formed elements Thelifespanoftheformedelementsisverybrief.Althoughonetypeofleukocytecalledmemorycellscansurviveforyears, most erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets normally live only a few hours to a few weeks.
Thus, the body must form new blood cells and platelets quickly and continuously.
When you donate a unit of blood during a blood drive (approximately 475 mL, or about 1 pint), your body typically replaces the donated plasma within 24 hours, but it takes about 4 to 6 weeks to replace the blood cells.
This restricts the frequency with which donors can contribute their blood.
The process by which this replacement occurs is called hemopoiesis, or hematopoiesis (from the Greek root haima- = ‚Äúblood‚Äù; -poiesis = ‚Äúproduction‚Äù).
Sites of Hemopoiesis Prior to birth, hemopoiesis occurs in a number of tissues, beginning with the yolk sac of the developing embryo, and continuing in the fetal liver, spleen, lymphatic tissue, and eventually the red bone marrow.
Following birth, most hemopoiesisoccursintheredmarrow,aconnectivetissuewithinthespacesofspongy(cancellous)bonetissue.Inchildren, hemopoiesis can occur in the medullary cavity of long bones; in adults, the process is largely restricted to the cranial and pelvic bones, the vertebrae, the sternum, and the proximal epiphyses of the femur and humerus.
Throughout adulthood, the liver and spleen maintain their ability to generate the formed elements.
This process is referred to as extramedullary hemopoiesis (meaning hemopoiesis outside the medullary cavity of adult bones).
When a disease such as bone cancer destroys the bone marrow, causing hemopoiesis to fail, extramedullary hemopoiesis may be initiated.
Differentiation of Formed Elements from Stem Cells All formed elements arise from stem cells of the red bone marrow.
Recall that stem cells undergo mitosis plus cytokinesis (cellular division) to give rise to new daughter cells: One of these remains a stem cell and the other differentiates into one of any number of diverse cell types.
Stem cells may be viewed as occupying a hierarchal system, with some loss of the ability to diversify at each step.
The totipotent stem cell is the zygote, or fertilized egg.
The totipotent (toti- = ‚Äúall‚Äù) stem cell gives rise to all cells of the human body.
The next level is the pluripotent stem cell , which gives rise to multiple types of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal membranes.
Beneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell that develops only into types of connective tissue, including fibrous connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue.
One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is the hemopoietic stem cell , or hemocytoblast.
All of the formed elements of blood originate from this specific type of cell.742 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called hemopoietic growth factors , which prompt it to divide and differentiate.
One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue.
The other daughter cell becomes either of two types of more specialized stem cells (Figure 18.4 ): ‚Ä¢Lymphoid stem cells give rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in immunity.
However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes progressessomewhatdifferentlyfromtheprocessfortheotherformedelements.Inbrief,lymphoidstemcellsquickly migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their production and differentiation continues.
B cells are so named since they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells mature in the thymus.
‚Ä¢Myeloidstemcells giverisetoalltheotherformedelements,includingtheerythrocytes;megakaryocytesthatproduce platelets; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to monocytes and three forms of granular leukocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.
Figure 18.4 Hematopoietic System of Bone Marrow Hemopoiesis is the proliferation and differentiation of the formed elements of blood.
Lymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and differentiate into mature formed elements.
As you can see in Figure 18.4, there are several intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells), many of which can be recognized by their names, which have the suffix -blast.
For instance, megakaryoblasts are the precursors of megakaryocytes, and proerythroblasts become reticulocytes, which eject their nucleus and most other organelles before maturing into erythrocytes.
Hemopoietic Growth Factors Development from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again initiated by hemopoietic growth factors.
These include the following: ‚Ä¢Erythropoietin(EPO) isaglycoproteinhormonesecretedbytheinterstitialfibroblastcellsofthekidneysinresponse to low oxygen levels.
It prompts the production of erythrocytes.
Some athletes use synthetic EPO as a performance- enhancing drug (called blood doping) to increase RBC counts and subsequently increase oxygen delivery to tissues throughoutthebody.EPOisabannedsubstanceinmostorganizedsports,butitisalsousedmedicallyinthetreatment of certain anemia, specifically those triggered by certain types of cancer, and other disorders in which increased erythrocyte counts and oxygen levels are desirable.CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 743 ‚Ä¢Thrombopoietin, another glycoprotein hormone, is produced by the liver and kidneys.
It triggers the development of megakaryocytes into platelets.
‚Ä¢Cytokines areglycoproteinssecretedbyawidevarietyofcells,includingredbonemarrow,leukocytes,macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.
They act locally as autocrine or paracrine factors, stimulating the proliferation of progenitor cells and helping to stimulate both nonspecific and specific resistance to disease.
There are two major subtypes of cytokines known as colony-stimulating factors and interleukins.
‚ó¶Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are glycoproteins that act locally, as autocrine or paracrine factors.
Some trigger the differentiation of myeloblasts into granular leukocytes, namely, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.
These are referred to as granulocyte CSFs.
A different CSF induces the production of monocytes, called monocyte CSFs.
Both granulocytes and monocytes are stimulated by GM-CSF; granulocytes, monocytes, platelets,anderythrocytesarestimulatedbymulti-CSF.Syntheticformsofthesehormonesareoftenadministered to patients with various forms of cancer who are receiving chemotherapy to revive their WBC counts.
‚ó¶Interleukins are another class of cytokine signaling molecules important in hemopoiesis.
They were initially thought to be secreted uniquely by leukocytes and to communicate only with other leukocytes, and were named accordingly, but are now known to be produced by a variety of cells including bone marrow and endothelium.
Researchersnowsuspectthatinterleukinsmayplayotherrolesinbodyfunctioning,includingdifferentiationand maturation of cells, producing immunity and inflammation.
To date, more than a dozen interleukins have been identified, with others likely to follow.
They are generally numbered IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, etc.
Blood Doping In its original intent, the term blood doping was used to describe the practice of injecting by transfusion supplemental RBCs into an individual, typically to enhance performance in a sport.
Additional RBCs would deliver more oxygen to the tissues, providing extra aerobic capacity, clinically referred to as VO 2max.
The source of the cells was either from the recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible blood (homologous).
This practice was aided by the well-developed techniques of harvesting, concentrating, and freezing of the RBCs that could be later thawed and injected, yet still retain their functionality.
These practices are considered illegal in virtually all sports and run the risk of infection, significantly increasing the viscosity of the blood and the potential for transmission of blood-borne pathogens if the blood was collected from another individual.
WiththedevelopmentofsyntheticEPOinthe1980s,itbecamepossibletoprovideadditionalRBCsbyartificially stimulating RBC production in the bone marrow.
Originally developed to treat patients suffering from anemia, renal failure,orcancertreatment,largequantitiesofEPOcanbegeneratedbyrecombinantDNAtechnology.SyntheticEPO is injected under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks.
It may also induce polycythemia and raise hematocrit to 70 or greater.
This increased viscosity raises the resistance of the blood and forces the heart to pump more powerfully; in extreme cases, it has resulted in death.
Other drugs such as cobalt II chloride have been shown to increase natural EPO gene expression.
Blood doping has become problematic in many sports, especially cycling.
Lance Armstrong, winner of seven Tour de France and many other cycling titles, was stripped of his victories and admitted to blood doping in 2013.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/doping) to see doctors discuss the dangers of blood doping in sports.
What are the some potential side effects of blood doping?744 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Bone Marrow Sampling and Transplants Sometimes, a healthcare provider will order a bone marrow biopsy, a diagnostic test of a sample of red bone marrow, or abone marrow transplant , a treatment in which a donor‚Äôs healthy bone marrow‚Äîand its stem cells‚Äîreplaces the faulty bonemarrowofapatient.Thesetestsandproceduresareoftenusedtoassistinthediagnosisandtreatmentofvarioussevere forms of anemia, such as thalassemia major and sickle cell anemia, as well as some types of cancer, specifically leukemia.
In the past, when a bone marrow sample or transplant was necessary, the procedure would have required inserting a large-bore needle into the region near the iliac crest of the pelvic bones (os coxae).
This location was preferred, since its location close to the body surface makes it more accessible, and it is relatively isolated from most vital organs.
Unfortunately, the procedure is quite painful.
Now, direct sampling of bone marrow can often be avoided.
In many cases, stem cells can be isolated in just a few hoursfromasampleofapatient‚Äôsblood.Theisolatedstemcellsarethengrownincultureusingtheappropriatehemopoietic growth factors, and analyzed or sometimes frozen for later use.
For an individual requiring a transplant, a matching donor is essential to prevent the immune system from destroying the donor cells‚Äîa phenomenon known as tissue rejection.
To treat patients with bone marrow transplants, it is first necessary to destroy the patient‚Äôs own diseased marrow through radiation and/or chemotherapy.
Donor bone marrow stem cells are then intravenously infused.
From the bloodstream, they establish themselves in the recipient‚Äô s bone marrow.
18.3|Erythrocytes By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the anatomy of erythrocytes ‚Ä¢Discuss the various steps in the lifecycle of an erythrocyte ‚Ä¢Explain the composition and function of hemoglobin Theerythrocyte , commonly known as a red blood cell (or RBC), is by far the most common formed element: A single dropofbloodcontainsmillionsoferythrocytesandjustthousandsofleukocytes.Specifically,maleshaveabout5.4million erythrocytes per microliter (¬µL) of blood, and females have approximately 4.8 million per ¬µL.
In fact, erythrocytes are estimated to make up about 25 percent of the total cells in the body.
As you can imagine, they are quite small cells, with a mean diameter of only about 7‚Äì8 micrometers (¬µm) (Figure 18.5).
The primary functions of erythrocytes are to pick up inhaled oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the body‚Äôs tissues, and to pick up some (about 24 percent) carbon dioxide waste at the tissues and transport it to the lungs for exhalation.
Erythrocytes remain within the vascular network.
Although leukocytestypicallyleavethebloodvesselstoperformtheirdefensivefunctions,movementoferythrocytesfromtheblood vessels is abnormal.CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 745 Figure 18.5 Summary of Formed Elements in Blood746 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles.
During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte , will still typically contain remnants of organelles.
Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1‚Äì2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells.
These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components.
Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration.
This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues.
They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins.
Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structuralproteinsthathelpthebloodcellsmaintaintheiruniquestructureandenablethemtochangetheirshapetosqueeze through capillaries.
This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element.
Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6).
Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will seeshortly,transportgases.Thebiconcaveshapealsoprovidesagreatersurfaceareaacrosswhichgasexchangecanoccur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio.
In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereassomeofthecarbondioxideproducedbythecellsasawasteproductdiffusesintothecapillariestobepickedupby the erythrocytes.
Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the passage of the erythrocytes and providing an extended opportunity for gas exchange to occur.
However, the space within capillaries can be so minute that, despite their own small size, erythrocytes may have to fold in on themselves if they are to make their way through.
Fortunately, their structural proteins like spectrin are flexible, allowing them to bend over themselves to a surprising degree, then spring back again when they enter a wider vessel.
In wider vessels, erythrocytes may stack up much like a roll of coins, forming a rouleaux, from the French word for ‚Äúroll.‚Äù Figure 18.6 Shape of Red Blood Cells Erythrocytes are biconcave discs with very shallow centers.
This shape optimizes the ratio of surface area to volume, facilitating gas exchange.
It also enables them to fold up as they move through narrow blood vessels.
Hemoglobin Hemoglobin is a large molecule made up of proteins and iron.
It consists of four folded chains of a protein called globin, designated alpha 1 and 2, and beta 1 and 2 (Figure 18.7a).
Each of these globin molecules is bound to a red pigment molecule called heme, which contains an ion of iron (Fe2+) (Figure 18.7b).CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 747 Figure 18.7 Hemoglobin (a) A molecule of hemoglobin contains four globin proteins, each of which is bound to one molecule of the iron-containing pigment heme.
(b) A single erythrocyte can contain 300 million hemoglobin molecules, and thus more than 1 billion oxygen molecules.
Each iron ion in the heme can bind to one oxygen molecule; therefore, each hemoglobin molecule can transport four oxygenmolecules.Anindividualerythrocytemaycontainabout300millionhemoglobinmolecules,andthereforecanbind to and transport up to 1.2 billion oxygen molecules (see Figure 18.7 b).
In the lungs, hemoglobin picks up oxygen, which binds to the iron ions, forming oxyhemoglobin.
The bright red, oxygenated hemoglobin travels to the body tissues, where it releases some of the oxygen molecules, becoming darker red deoxyhemoglobin, sometimes referred to as reduced hemoglobin.
Oxygen release depends on the need for oxygen in the surrounding tissues, so hemoglobin rarely if ever leaves all of its oxygen behind.
In the capillaries, carbon dioxide enters the bloodstream.
About 76 percent dissolves in the plasma, some of it remaining as dissolved CO 2, and the remainder forming bicarbonate ion.
About 23‚Äì24 percent of it binds to the amino acids in hemoglobin, forming a molecule known as carbaminohemoglobin.
From the capillaries, the hemoglobin carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, where it releases it for exchange of oxygen.
Changes in the levels of RBCs can have significant effects on the body‚Äôs ability to effectively deliver oxygen to the tissues.
Ineffective hematopoiesis results in insufficient numbers of RBCs and results in one of several forms of anemia.
An overproduction of RBCs produces a condition called polycythemia.
The primary drawback with polycythemia is not a failuretodirectlydeliverenoughoxygentothetissues,butrathertheincreasedviscosityoftheblood,whichmakesitmore difficult for the heart to circulate the blood.
In patients with insufficient hemoglobin, the tissues may not receive sufficient oxygen, resulting in another form of anemia.
In determining oxygenation of tissues, the value of greatest interest in healthcare is the percent saturation; that is, the percentage of hemoglobin sites occupied by oxygen in a patient‚Äôs blood.
Clinically this value is commonly referred to simply as ‚Äúpercent sat.‚Äù Percent saturation is normally monitored using a device known as a pulse oximeter, which is applied to a thin part of the body, typically the tip of the patient‚Äôs finger.
The device works by sending two different wavelengths of light (one red, the other infrared) through the finger and measuring the light with a photodetector as it exits.
Hemoglobin absorbs light differentially depending upon its saturation with oxygen.
The machine calibrates the amount of light received by the photodetector against the amount absorbed by the partially oxygenated hemoglobin and presents the data as percent saturation.Normalpulseoximeterreadingsrangefrom95‚Äì100percent.Lowerpercentagesreflect hypoxemia,orlowblood oxygen.Thetermhypoxiaismoregenericandsimplyreferstolowoxygenlevels.Oxygenlevelsarealsodirectlymonitored from free oxygen in the plasma typically following an arterial stick.
When this method is applied, the amount of oxygen presentisexpressedintermsofpartialpressureofoxygenorsimplypO 2andistypicallyrecordedinunitsofmillimetersof mercury, mm Hg.
The kidneys filter about 180 liters (~380 pints) of blood in an average adult each day, or about 20 percent of the total resting volume, and thus serve as ideal sites for receptors that determine oxygen saturation.
In response to hypoxemia, less oxygen will exit the vessels supplying the kidney, resulting in hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) in the tissue fluid of thekidneywhereoxygenconcentrationisactuallymonitored.InterstitialfibroblastswithinthekidneysecreteEPO,thereby increasing erythrocyte production and restoring oxygen levels.
In a classic negative-feedback loop, as oxygen saturation rises, EPO secretion falls, and vice versa, thereby maintaining homeostasis.
Populations dwelling at high elevations, with inherently lower levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, naturally maintain a hematocrit higher than people living at sea level.
Consequently, people traveling to high elevations may experience symptoms of hypoxemia, such as fatigue, headache, and shortness of breath, for a few days after their arrival.
In response to the hypoxemia, the kidneys secrete EPO to step up the production of erythrocytes until homeostasis is achieved once again.
To avoid the symptoms of hypoxemia, or altitude sickness, mountain climbers typically rest for several days to a week or more at a series of camps situated at increasing748 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 elevations to allow EPO levels and, consequently, erythrocyte counts to rise.
When climbing the tallest peaks, such as Mt.
Everest and K2 in the Himalayas, many mountain climbers rely upon bottled oxygen as they near the summit.
Lifecycle of Erythrocytes Production of erythrocytes in the marrow occurs at the staggering rate of more than 2 million cells per second.
For this production to occur, a number of raw materials must be present in adequate amounts.
These include the same nutrients that are essential to the production and maintenance of any cell, such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids.
However, erythrocyte production also requires several trace elements: ‚Ä¢Iron.
We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron.
On average,lessthan20percentoftheironweconsumeisabsorbed.Hemeiron,fromanimalfoodssuchasmeat,poultry, and fish, is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods.
Upon absorption, iron becomes part of the body‚Äôs total iron pool.
The bone marrow, liver, and spleen can store iron in the protein compounds ferritinand hemosiderin.
Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma membranes and from its storage sites into tissue fluid where it enters the blood.
When EPO stimulates the production of erythrocytes, iron is released from storage, bound to transferrin, and carried to the red marrow where it attaches to erythrocyte precursors.

‚Ä¢Zinc.Thetracemineralzincfunctionsasaco-enzymethatfacilitatesthesynthesisofthehemeportionofhemoglobin.
‚Ä¢B vitamins.
The B vitamins folate and vitamin B 12function as co-enzymes that facilitate DNA synthesis.
Thus, both are critical for the synthesis of new cells, including erythrocytes.
Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation, after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid phagocytic cell called a macrophage, located primarily within the bone marrow, liver, and spleen.
The components of the degraded erythrocytes‚Äô hemoglobin are further processed as follows: ‚Ä¢Globin, the protein portion of hemoglobin, is broken down into amino acids, which can be sent back to the bone marrow to be used in the production of new erythrocytes.
Hemoglobin that is not phagocytized is broken down in the circulation, releasing alpha and beta chains that are removed from circulation by the kidneys.
‚Ä¢The iron contained in the heme portion of hemoglobin may be stored in the liver or spleen, primarily in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin, or carried through the bloodstream by transferrin to the red bone marrow for recycling into new erythrocytes.
‚Ä¢The non-iron portion of heme is degraded into the waste product biliverdin , a green pigment, and then into another waste product, bilirubin, a yellow pigment.
Bilirubin binds to albumin and travels in the blood to the liver, which uses it in the manufacture of bile, a compound released into the intestines to help emulsify dietary fats.
In the large intestine,bacteriabreaksthebilirubinapartfromthebileandconvertsittourobilinogenandthenintostercobilin.Itis then eliminated from the body in the feces.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics typically eliminate these bacteria as well and mayalterthecoloroffeces.Thekidneysalsoremoveanycirculatingbilirubinandotherrelatedmetabolicbyproducts such as urobilins and secrete them into the urine.
The breakdown pigments formed from the destruction of hemoglobin can be seen in a variety of situations.
At the site of an injury, biliverdin from damaged RBCs produces some of the dramatic colors associated with bruising.
With a failing liver, bilirubin cannot be removed effectively from circulation and causes the body to assume a yellowish tinge associated with jaundice.
Stercobilins within the feces produce the typical brown color associated with this waste.
And the yellow of urine is associated with the urobilins.
The erythrocyte lifecycle is summarized in Figure 18.8 .CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 749 Figure 18.8 Erythrocyte Lifecycle Erythrocytes are produced in the bone marrow and sent into the circulation.
At the end of their lifecycle, they are destroyed by macrophages, and their components are recycled.
Disorders of Erythrocytes The size, shape, and number of erythrocytes, and the number of hemoglobin molecules can have a major impact on a person‚Äôs health.
When the number of RBCs or hemoglobin is deficient, the general condition is called anemia.
There are more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3.5 million Americans suffer from this condition.
Anemia can be broken down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs.
Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach focusesonevaluatingtheproduction,destruction,andremovalofRBCs,whereasthemorphologicalapproachexaminesthe750 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 RBCs themselves, paying particular emphasis to their size.
A common test is the mean corpuscle volume (MCV), which measuressize.Normal-sizedcellsarereferredtoasnormocytic,smaller-than-normalcellsarereferredtoasmicrocytic,and larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic.
Reticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate production of RBCs.
The effects of the various anemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin willresultinlowerlevelsofoxygenbeingdeliveredtobodytissues.Sinceoxygenisrequiredfortissuefunctioning,anemia produces fatigue, lethargy, and an increased risk for infection.
An oxygen deficit in the brain impairs the ability to think clearly, and may prompt headaches and irritability.
Lack of oxygen leaves the patient short of breath, even as the heart and lungs work harder in response to the deficit.
Blood loss anemias are fairly straightforward.
In addition to bleeding from wounds or other lesions, these forms of anemiamaybeduetoulcers,hemorrhoids,inflammationofthestomach(gastritis),andsomecancersofthegastrointestinal tract.
The excessive use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can trigger ulceration and gastritis.
Excessive menstruation and loss of blood during childbirth are also potential causes.
Anemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells.
‚Ä¢A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cell anemia).
A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S, which delivers less oxygen to tissues and causes erythrocytes to assume a sickle (or crescent) shape, especially at low oxygen concentrations (Figure 18.9).
These abnormally shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow capillaries because they are unable to fold in on themselves to squeeze through, blocking blood flow to tissues and causing a variety of serious problems from painful joints to delayed growth and even blindness and cerebrovascular accidents (strokes).
Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of African descent.
Figure 18.9 Sickle Cells Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in one of the hemoglobin genes.
Erythrocytes produce an abnormal type of hemoglobin, which causes the cell to take on a sickle or crescent shape.

This condition can occur in individuals with a deficiency of iron in the diet and is especially common in teens and children as well as in vegans and vegetarians.
Additionally, iron deficiency anemia may be caused by either an inability to absorb and transport iron or slow , chronic bleeding.
‚Ä¢Vitamin-deficient anemias generally involve insufficient vitamin B12 and folate.
‚ó¶Megaloblastic anemia involves a deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folate, and often involves diets deficient in theseessentialnutrients.Lackofmeatoraviablealternatesource,andovercookingoreatinginsufficientamounts of vegetables may lead to a lack of folate.
‚ó¶PerniciousanemiaiscausedbypoorabsorptionofvitaminB12andisoftenseeninpatientswithCrohn‚Äôsdisease (a severe intestinal disorder often treated by surgery), surgical removal of the intestines or stomach (common in some weight loss surgeries), intestinal parasites, and AIDS.
‚ó¶Pregnancies, some medications, excessive alcohol consumption, and some diseases such as celiac disease are also associated with vitamin deficiencies.
It is essential to provide sufficient folic acid during the early stages of pregnancy to reduce the risk of neurological defects, including spina bifida, a failure of the neural tube to close.CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 751 ‚Ä¢Assorted disease processes can also interfere with the production and formation of RBCs and hemoglobin.
If myeloid stem cells are defective or replaced by cancer cells, there will be insuf ficient quantities of RBCs produced.
‚ó¶AplasticanemiaistheconditioninwhichtherearedeficientnumbersofRBCstemcells.Aplasticanemiaisoften inherited, or it may be triggered by radiation, medication, chemotherapy , or infection.
‚ó¶Thalassemia is an inherited condition typically occurring in individuals from the Middle East, the Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asia, in which maturation of the RBCs does not proceed normally.
The most severe form is called Cooley‚Äôs anemia.
‚ó¶Lead exposure from industrial sources or even dust from paint chips of iron-containing paints or pottery that has not been properly glazed may also lead to destruction of the red marrow .
‚Ä¢Various disease processes also can lead to anemias.
These include chronic kidney diseases often associated with a decreased production of EPO, hypothyroidism, some forms of cancer , lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Incontrasttoanemia,anelevatedRBCcountiscalled polycythemia andisdetectedinapatient‚Äôselevatedhematocrit.
It can occur transiently in a person who is dehydrated; when water intake is inadequate or water losses are excessive, the plasma volume falls.
As a result, the hematocrit rises.
For reasons mentioned earlier, a mild form of polycythemia is chronic but normal in people living at high altitudes.
Some elite athletes train at high elevations specifically to induce this phenomenon.
Finally, a type of bone marrow disease called polycythemia vera (from the Greek vera = ‚Äútrue‚Äù) causes an excessive production of immature erythrocytes.
Polycythemia vera can dangerously elevate the viscosity of blood, raising blood pressure and making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood throughout the body.
It is a relatively rare disease that occurs more often in men than women, and is more likely to be present in elderly patients those over 60 years of age.
18.4|Leukocytes and Platelets By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the general characteristics of leukocytes ‚Ä¢Classify leukocytes according to their lineage, their main structural features, and their primary functions ‚Ä¢Discuss the most common malignancies involving leukocytes ‚Ä¢Identify the lineage, basic structure, and function of platelets Theleukocyte, commonly known as a white blood cell (or WBC), is a major component of the body‚Äôs defenses against disease.LeukocytesprotectthebodyagainstinvadingmicroorganismsandbodycellswithmutatedDNA,andtheycleanup debris.
Platelets are essential for the repair of blood vessels when damage to them has occurred; they also provide growth factors for healing and repair.
See Figure 18.5 for a summary of leukocytes and platelets.
Characteristics of Leukocytes Although leukocytes and erythrocytes both originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, they are very different from each other in many significant ways.
For instance, leukocytes are far less numerous than erythrocytes: Typicallythereareonly5000to10,000per ¬µL.Theyarealsolargerthanerythrocytesandaretheonlyformedelementsthat are complete cells, possessing a nucleus and organelles.
And although there is just one type of erythrocyte, there are many typesofleukocytes.Mostofthesetypeshaveamuchshorterlifespanthanthatoferythrocytes,someasshortasafewhours or even a few minutes in the case of acute infection.
One of the most distinctive characteristics of leukocytes is their movement.
Whereas erythrocytes spend their days circulating within the blood vessels, leukocytes routinely leave the bloodstream to perform their defensive functions in the body‚Äôs tissues.
For leukocytes, the vascular network is simply a highway they travel and soon exit to reach their true destination.
When they arrive, they are often given distinct names, such as macrophage or microglia, depending on their function.
As shown in Figure 18.10 , they leave the capillaries‚Äîthe smallest blood vessels‚Äîor other small vessels through a process known as emigration (from the Latin for ‚Äúremoval‚Äù) or diapedesis (dia- = ‚Äúthrough‚Äù; -pedan = ‚Äúto leap‚Äù) in which they squeeze through adjacent cells in a blood vessel wall.
Once they have exited the capillaries, some leukocytes will take up fixed positions in lymphatic tissue, bone marrow, the spleen, the thymus, or other organs.
Others will move about through the tissue spaces very much like amoebas, continuously extending their plasma membranes, sometimes wandering freely, and sometimes moving toward the direction inwhichtheyaredrawnbychemicalsignals.Thisattractingofleukocytesoccursbecauseof positivechemotaxis (literally ‚Äúmovement in response to chemicals‚Äù), a phenomenon in which injured or infected cells and nearby leukocytes emit the equivalentofachemical‚Äú911‚Äùcall,attractingmoreleukocytestothesite.Inclinicalmedicine,thedifferentialcountsofthe types and percentages of leukocytes present are often key indicators in making a diagnosis and selecting a treatment.752 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure18.10Emigration Leukocytes exit the blood vessel and then move through the connective tissue of the dermis toward the site of a wound.
Some leukocytes, such as the eosinophil and neutrophil, are characterized as granular leukocytes.
They release chemicals from their granules that destroy pathogens; they are also capable of phagocytosis.
The monocyte, an agranular leukocyte, differentiates into a macrophage that then phagocytizes the pathogens.
Classification of Leukocytes When scientists first began to observe stained blood slides, it quickly became evident that leukocytes could be divided into two groups, according to whether their cytoplasm contained highly visible granules: ‚Ä¢Granular leukocytes contain abundant granules within the cytoplasm.
They include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils (you can view their lineage from myeloid stem cells in Figure 18.4 ).CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 753 ‚Ä¢While granules are not totally lacking in agranular leukocytes, they are far fewer and less obvious.
Agranular leukocytes include monocytes, which mature into macrophages that are phagocytic, and lymphocytes, which arise from the lymphoid stem cell line.
Granular Leukocytes Wewillconsiderthegranularleukocytesinorderfrommostcommontoleastcommon.Alloftheseareproducedinthered bonemarrowandhaveashortlifespanofhourstodays.Theytypicallyhavealobednucleusandareclassifiedaccordingto which type of stain best highlights their granules ( Figure 18.11).
Figure 18.11 Granular Leukocytes A neutrophil has small granules that stain light lilac and a nucleus with two to five lobes.
An eosinophil‚Äôs granules are slightly larger and stain reddish-orange, and its nucleus has two to three lobes.
A basophil has large granules that stain dark blue to purple and a two-lobed nucleus.
The most common of all the leukocytes, neutrophils will normally comprise 50‚Äì70 percent of total leukocyte count.
They are 10‚Äì12 ¬µm in diameter, significantly larger than erythrocytes.
They are called neutrophils because their granules show up most clearly with stains that are chemically neutral (neither acidic nor basic).
The granules are numerous but quite fine and normally appear light lilac.
The nucleus has a distinct lobed appearance and may have two to five lobes, the number increasing with the age of the cell.
Older neutrophils have increasing numbers of lobes and are often referred to as polymorphonuclear (a nucleus with many forms), or simply ‚Äúpolys.‚Äù Younger and immature neutrophils begin to develop lobes and are known as ‚Äúbands.‚Äù Neutrophils are rapid responders to the site of infection and are efficient phagocytes with a preference for bacteria.
Their granules include lysozyme, an enzyme capable of lysing, or breaking down, bacterial cell walls; oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide; and defensins, proteins that bind to and puncture bacterial and fungal plasma membranes, so that the cell contents leak out.
Abnormally high counts of neutrophils indicate infection and/or inflammation, particularly triggeredbybacteria,butarealsofoundinburnpatientsandothersexperiencingunusualstress.Aburninjuryincreasesthe proliferation of neutrophils in order to fight off infection that can result from the destruction of the barrier of the skin.
Low counts may be caused by drug toxicity and other disorders, and may increase an individual‚Äô s susceptibility to infection.
Eosinophils typicallyrepresent2‚Äì4percentoftotalleukocytecount.Theyarealso10‚Äì12 ¬µmindiameter.Thegranules of eosinophils stain best with an acidic stain known as eosin.
The nucleus of the eosinophil will typically have two to three lobes and, if stained properly, the granules will have a distinct red to orange color.
The granules of eosinophils include antihistamine molecules, which counteract the activities of histamines, inflammatory chemicals produced by basophils and mast cells.
Some eosinophil granules contain molecules toxic to parasitic worms, which can enter the body through the integument, or when an individual consumes raw or undercooked fish or meat.
Eosinophils are also capable of phagocytosis and are particularly effective when antibodies bind to the target and form an antigen-antibody complex.
High counts of eosinophils are typical of patients experiencing allergies, parasitic worm infestations, and some autoimmune diseases.
Low counts may be due to drug toxicity and stress.
Basophils are the least common leukocytes, typically comprising less than one percent of the total leukocyte count.
Theyareslightlysmallerthanneutrophilsandeosinophilsat8‚Äì10 ¬µmindiameter.Thegranulesofbasophilsstainbestwith basic (alkaline) stains.
Basophils contain large granules that pick up a dark blue stain and are so common they may make it difficult to see the two-lobed nucleus.
In general, basophils intensify the inflammatory response.
They share this trait with mast cells.
In the past, mast cells were considered to be basophils that left the circulation.
However, this appears not to be the case, as the two cell types develop from different lineages.
The granules of basophils release histamines, which contribute to inflammation, and heparin, which opposes blood clotting.
High counts of basophils are associated with allergies, parasitic infections, and hypothyroidism.
Low counts are associated with pregnancy, stress, and hyperthyroidism.
Agranular Leukocytes Agranular leukocytes contain smaller, less-visible granules in their cytoplasm than do granular leukocytes.
The nucleus is simple in shape, sometimes with an indentation but without distinct lobes.
There are two major types of agranulocytes: lymphocytes and monocytes (see Figure 18.4 ).
Lymphocytes are theonlyformedelementofbloodthatarisesfromlymphoidstemcells.Althoughtheyforminitially in the bone marrow, much of their subsequent development and reproduction occurs in the lymphatic tissues.
Lymphocytes are the second most common type of leukocyte, accounting for about 20‚Äì30 percent of all leukocytes, and are essential for754 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 the immune response.
The size range of lymphocytes is quite extensive, with some authorities recognizing two size classes and others three.
Typically, the large cells are 10‚Äì14 ¬µm and have a smaller nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and more granules.
The smaller cells are typically 6‚Äì9 ¬µm with a larger volume of nucleus to cytoplasm, creating a ‚Äúhalo‚Äù effect.
A few cells may fall outside these ranges, at 14‚Äì17 ¬µm.
This finding has led to the three size range classification.
The three major groups of lymphocytes include natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells.
Natural killer (NK) cells are capable of recognizing cells that do not express ‚Äúself‚Äù proteins on their plasma membrane or that contain foreign or abnormal markers.
These ‚Äúnonself‚Äù cells include cancer cells, cells infected with a virus, and other cells with atypical surface proteins.
Thus, they provide generalized, nonspecific immunity .
The larger lymphocytes are typically NK cells.
B cells and T cells, also called B lymphocytes andT lymphocytes, play prominent roles in defending the body against specific pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) and are involved in specific immunity.
One form of B cells (plasmacells)producestheantibodiesorimmunoglobulinsthatbindtospecificforeignorabnormalcomponentsofplasma membranes.Thisisalsoreferredtoashumoral(bodyfluid)immunity.Tcellsprovidecellular-levelimmunitybyphysically attackingforeignordiseasedcells.A memorycell isavarietyofbothBandTcellsthatformsafterexposuretoapathogen and mounts rapid responses upon subsequent exposures.
Unlike other leukocytes, memory cells live for many years.
B cells undergo a maturation process in the bone marrow, whereas T cells undergo maturation in the thymus.
This site of the maturation process gives rise to the name B and T cells.
The functions of lymphocytes are complex and will be covered in detail in the chapter covering the lymphatic system and immunity.
Smaller lymphocytes are either B or T cells, although they cannot be differentiated in a normal blood smear.
Abnormally high lymphocyte counts are characteristic of viral infections as well as some types of cancer.
Abnormally low lymphocyte counts are characteristic of prolonged (chronic) illness or immunosuppression, including that caused by HIV infection and drug therapies that often involve steroids.
Monocytes originatefrommyeloidstemcells.Theynormallyrepresent2‚Äì8percentofthetotalleukocytecount.They are typically easily recognized by their large size of 12‚Äì20 ¬µm and indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei.
Macrophages are monocytes that have left the circulation and phagocytize debris, foreign pathogens, worn-out erythrocytes, and many other dead, worn out, or damaged cells.
Macrophages also release antimicrobial defensins and chemotactic chemicals that attract other leukocytes to the site of an infection.
Some macrophages occupy fixed locations, whereas others wander through the tissue fluid.
Abnormally high counts of monocytes are associated with viral or fungal infections, tuberculosis, and some forms of leukemia and other chronic diseases.
Abnormally low counts are typically caused by suppression of the bone marrow .
Lifecycle of Leukocytes Most leukocytes have a relatively short lifespan, typically measured in hours or days.
Production of all leukocytes begins in the bone marrow under the influence of CSFs and interleukins.
Secondary production and maturation of lymphocytes occursinspecificregionsoflymphatictissueknownasgerminalcenters.Lymphocytesarefullycapableofmitosisandmay produce clones of cells with identical properties.
This capacity enables an individual to maintain immunity throughout life to many threats that have been encountered in the past.
Disorders of Leukocytes Leukopenia is a condition in which too few leukocytes are produced.
If this condition is pronounced, the individual may be unable to ward off disease.
Excessive leukocyte proliferation is known as leukocytosis.
Although leukocyte counts are high, the cells themselves are often nonfunctional, leaving the individual at increased risk for disease.
Leukemia is a cancer involving an abundance of leukocytes.
It may involve only one specific type of leukocyte from either the myeloid line (myelocytic leukemia) or the lymphoid line (lymphocytic leukemia).
In chronic leukemia, mature leukocytesaccumulateandfailtodie.Inacuteleukemia,thereisanoverproductionofyoung,immatureleukocytes.Inboth conditions the cells do not function properly.
Lymphoma is a form of cancer in which masses of malignant T and/or B lymphocytes collect in lymph nodes, the spleen, the liver, and other tissues.
As in leukemia, the malignant leukocytes do not function properly, and the patient is vulnerable to infection.
Some forms of lymphoma tend to progress slowly and respond well to treatment.
Others tend to progress quickly and require aggressive treatment, without which they are rapidly fatal.
Platelets You may occasionally see platelets referred to as thrombocytes, but because this name suggests they are a type of cell, it is not accurate.
A platelet is not a cell but rather a fragment of the cytoplasm of a cell called a megakaryocyte that is surroundedbyaplasmamembrane.Megakaryocytesaredescendedfrommyeloidstemcells(see Figure18.4)andarelarge, typically 50‚Äì100 ¬µm in diameter, and contain an enlarged, lobed nucleus.
As noted earlier, thrombopoietin, a glycoprotein secretedbythekidneysandliver,stimulatestheproliferationofmegakaryoblasts,whichmatureintomegakaryocytes.These remainwithinbonemarrowtissue(Figure18.12)andultimatelyformplatelet-precursorextensionsthatextendthroughthe walls of bone marrow capillaries to release into the circulation thousands of cytoplasmic fragments, each enclosed by a bit of plasma membrane.
These enclosed fragments are platelets.
Each megakarocyte releases 2000‚Äì3000 platelets during its lifespan.
Following platelet release, megakaryocyte remnants, which are little more than a cell nucleus, are consumed by macrophages.CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 755 Platelets are relatively small, 2‚Äì4 ¬µm in diameter, but numerous, with typically 150,000‚Äì160,000 per ¬µL of blood.
After entering the circulation, approximately one-third migrate to the spleen for storage for later release in response to any rupture in a blood vessel.
They then become activated to perform their primary function, which is to limit blood loss.
Platelets remain only about 10 days, then are phagocytized by macrophages.
Plateletsarecriticaltohemostasis,thestoppageofbloodflowfollowingdamagetoavessel.Theyalsosecreteavariety ofgrowthfactorsessentialforgrowthandrepairoftissue,particularlyconnectivetissue.Infusionsofconcentratedplatelets are now being used in some therapies to stimulate healing.
Disorders of Platelets Thrombocytosis is a condition in which there are too many platelets.
This may trigger formation of unwanted blood clots (thrombosis), a potentially fatal disorder.
If there is an insufficient number of platelets, called thrombocytopenia, blood may not clot properly, and excessive bleeding may result.

Are you able to recognize and identify the various formed elements?
You will need to do this is a systematic manner, scanning along the image.
The standard method is to use a grid, but this is not possible with this resource.
Try constructing a simple table with each leukocyte type and then making a mark for each cell type you identify.
Attempt to classify at least 50 and perhaps as many as 100 different cells.
Based on the percentage of cells that you count, do the numbers represent a normal blood smear or does something appear to be abnormal?
18.5|Hemostasis By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the three mechanisms involved in hemostasis ‚Ä¢Explain how the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways lead to the common pathway, and the coagulation factors involved in each ‚Ä¢Discuss disorders affecting hemostasis Platelets are key players in hemostasis, the process by which the body seals a ruptured blood vessel and prevents further loss of blood.
Although rupture of larger vessels usually requires medical intervention, hemostasis is quite effective in dealing with small, simple wounds.
There are three steps to the process: vascular spasm, the formation of a platelet plug, and coagulation (blood clotting).
Failure of any of these steps will result in hemorrhage‚Äîexcessive bleeding.
Vascular Spasm Whenavesselisseveredorpunctured,orwhenthewallofavesselisdamaged,vascularspasmoccurs.In vascularspasm, the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel contracts dramatically.
This smooth muscle has both circular layers; larger vesselsalsohavelongitudinallayers.Thecircularlayerstendtoconstricttheflowofblood,whereasthelongitudinallayers, whenpresent,drawthevesselbackintothesurroundingtissue,oftenmakingitmoredifficultforasurgeontolocate,clamp, andtieoffaseveredvessel.Thevascularspasmresponseisbelievedtobetriggeredbyseveralchemicalscalledendothelins that are released by vessel-lining cells and by pain receptors in response to vessel injury.
This phenomenon typically lasts for up to 30 minutes, although it can last for hours.
Formation of the Platelet Plug In the second step, platelets, which normally float free in the plasma, encounter the area of vessel rupture with the exposed underlying connective tissue and collagenous fibers.
The platelets begin to clump together, become spiked and sticky, and bind to the exposed collagen and endothelial lining.
This process is assisted by a glycoprotein in the blood plasma calledCHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 757 von Willebrand factor, which helps stabilize the growing platelet plug.
As platelets collect, they simultaneously release chemicals from their granules into the plasma that further contribute to hemostasis.
Among the substances released by the platelets are: ‚Ä¢adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which helps additional platelets to adhere to the injury site, reinforcing and expanding the platelet plug ‚Ä¢serotonin, which maintains vasoconstriction ‚Ä¢prostaglandinsandphospholipids,whichalsomaintainvasoconstrictionandhelptoactivatefurtherclottingchemicals, as discussed next A platelet plug can temporarily seal a small opening in a blood vessel.
Plug formation, in essence, buys the body time while more sophisticated and durable repairs are being made.
In a similar manner, even modern naval warships still carry an assortment of wooden plugs to temporarily repair small breaches in their hulls until permanent repairs can be made.
Coagulation Those more sophisticated and more durable repairs are collectively called coagulation, the formation of a blood clot.

Figure18.14 summarizes the three steps of hemostasis.758 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 18.14 Hemostasis (a) An injury to a blood vessel initiates the process of hemostasis.
Blood clotting involves three steps.
First, vascular spasm constricts the flow of blood.
Next, a platelet plug forms to temporarily seal small openings in the vessel.
Coagulation then enables the repair of the vessel wall once the leakage of blood has stopped.
(b) The synthesis of fibrin in blood clots involves either an intrinsic pathway or an extrinsic pathway, both of which lead to a common pathway.
(credit a: Kevin MacKenzie) Clotting Factors Involved in Coagulation In the coagulation cascade, chemicals called clotting factors (or coagulation factors) prompt reactions that activate still more coagulation factors.
The process is complex, but is initiated along two basic pathways: ‚Ä¢The extrinsic pathway, which normally is triggered by trauma.
‚Ä¢The intrinsic pathway, which begins in the bloodstream and is triggered by internal damage to the wall of the vessel.
Bothofthesemergeintoathirdpathway,referredtoasthecommonpathway(see Figure18.14b).Allthreepathways aredependentuponthe12knownclottingfactors,includingCa2+andvitaminK(Table18.1).Clottingfactorsaresecreted primarily by the liver and the platelets.
The liver requires the fat-soluble vitamin K to produce many of them.
Vitamin K (along with biotin and folate) is somewhat unusual among vitamins in that it is not only consumed in the diet but is alsoCHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 759 synthesized by bacteria residing in the large intestine.
The calcium ion, considered factor IV, is derived from the diet and from the breakdown of bone.
Some recent evidence indicates that activation of various clotting factors occurs on specific receptor sites on the surfaces of platelets.
The 12 clotting factors are numbered I through XIII according to the order of their discovery.
Factor VI was once believedtobeadistinctclottingfactor,butisnowthoughttobeidenticaltofactorV.Ratherthanrenumbertheotherfactors, factor VI was allowed to remain as a placeholder and also a reminder that knowledge changes over time.

Extrinsic Pathway The quicker responding and more direct extrinsic pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) begins when damage occurs to the surrounding tissues, such as in a traumatic injury.
Upon contact with blood plasma, the damaged extravascularcells,whichareextrinsictothebloodstream,releasefactorIII(thromboplastin).Sequentially,Ca2+thenfactor VII (proconvertin), which is activated by factor III, are added, forming an enzyme complex.
This enzyme complex leads to activation of factor X (Stuart‚ÄìPrower factor), which activates the common pathway discussed below.
The events in the extrinsic pathway are completed in a matter of seconds.
Intrinsic Pathway Theintrinsicpathway (alsoknownasthecontactactivationpathway)islongerandmorecomplex.Inthiscase,thefactors involvedareintrinsicto(presentwithin)thebloodstream.Thepathwaycanbepromptedbydamagetothetissues,resulting from internal factors such as arterial disease; however, it is most often initiated when factor XII (Hageman factor) comes into contact with foreign materials, such as when a blood sample is put into a glass test tube.
Within the body, factor XII is typically activated when it encounters negatively charged molecules, such as inorganic polymers and phosphate760 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 produced earlier in the series of intrinsic pathway reactions.
Factor XII sets off a series of reactions that in turn activates factor XI (antihemolytic factor C or plasma thromboplastin antecedent) then factor IX (antihemolytic factor B or plasma thromboplasmin).Inthemeantime,chemicalsreleasedbytheplateletsincreasetherateoftheseactivationreactions.Finally, factor VIII (antihemolytic factor A) from the platelets and endothelial cells combines with factor IX (antihemolytic factor Borplasmathromboplasmin)toformanenzymecomplexthatactivatesfactorX(Stuart‚ÄìProwerfactororthrombokinase), leading to the common pathway.
The events in the intrinsic pathway are completed in a few minutes.
Common Pathway Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways lead to the common pathway, in which fibrin is produced to seal off the vessel.
OncefactorXhasbeenactivatedbyeithertheintrinsicorextrinsicpathway,theenzymeprothrombinaseconvertsfactorII, the inactive enzyme prothrombin, into the active enzyme thrombin.
(Note that if the enzyme thrombin were not normally inaninactiveform,clotswouldformspontaneously,aconditionnotconsistentwithlife.
)Then,thrombinconvertsfactorI, the insoluble fibrinogen, into the soluble fibrin protein strands.
Factor XIII then stabilizes the fibrin clot.
Fibrinolysis The stabilized clot is acted upon by contractile proteins within the platelets.
As these proteins contract, they pull on the fibrin threads, bringing the edges of the clot more tightly together, somewhat as we do when tightening loose shoelaces (seeFigure 18.14a).
This process also wrings out of the clot a small amount of fluid called serum, which is blood plasma without its clotting factors.
To restore normal blood flow as the vessel heals, the clot must eventually be removed.
Fibrinolysis is the gradual degradation of the clot.
Again, there is a fairly complicated series of reactions that involves factor XII and protein- catabolizing enzymes.
During this process, the inactive protein plasminogen is converted into the active plasmin, which gradually breaks down the fibrin of the clot.
Additionally, bradykinin, a vasodilator, is released, reversing the effects of the serotoninandprostaglandinsfromtheplatelets.Thisallowsthesmoothmuscleinthewallsofthevesselstorelaxandhelps to restore the circulation.
Plasma Anticoagulants Ananticoagulant is any substance that opposes coagulation.
Several circulating plasma anticoagulants play a role in limiting the coagulation process to the region of injury and restoring a normal, clot-free condition of blood.
For instance, a cluster of proteins collectively referred to as the protein C system inactivates clotting factors involved in the intrinsic pathway.
TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) inhibits the conversion of the inactive factor VII to the active form in the extrinsic pathway.
Antithrombin inactivates factor X and opposes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin in the common pathway.
And as noted earlier, basophils release heparin, a short-acting anticoagulant that also opposes prothrombin.
Heparin is also found on the surfaces of cells lining the blood vessels.
A pharmaceutical form of heparin is often administered therapeutically, for example, in surgical patients at risk for blood clots.
View these animations (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/coagulation) to explore the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways that are involved the process of coagulation.

Disorders of Clotting Either an insufficient or an excessive production of platelets can lead to severe disease or death.
As discussed earlier, an insufficient number of platelets, called thrombocytopenia, typically results in the inability of blood to form clots.
This can lead to excessive bleeding, even from minor wounds.
Another reason for failure of the blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more clotting factors.
This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia, which is actually a group of related disorders, theCHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 761 most common of which is hemophilia A, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases.
This disorder results in the inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII.
Hemophilia B is the second most common form, accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases.
In this case, there is a deficiency of factor IX.
Both of these defects are linked to the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy (carrier) mother to her male offspring, since males are XY.
Females would need to inherit a defective gene from each parent to manifest the disease, since they are XX.
Patients with hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds, and leak blood into joint spaces after exercise and into urine and stool.
Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an autosomal (not sex) chromosome that renders factor XI nonfunctional.
It is not a true recessive condition, since even individuals with a single copy of the mutant gene show a tendency to bleed.
Regular infusions of clotting factors isolated from healthy donors can help prevent bleeding in hemophiliac patients.
At some point, genetic therapy will become a viable option.
In contrast to the disorders characterized by coagulation failure is thrombocytosis, also mentioned earlier, a condition characterized by excessive numbers of platelets that increases the risk for excessive clot formation, a condition known as thrombosis.
A thrombus (plural = thrombi) is an aggregation of platelets, erythrocytes, and even WBCs typically trapped withinamassoffibrinstrands.Whiletheformationofaclotisnormalfollowingthehemostaticmechanismjustdescribed, thrombi can form within an intact or only slightly damaged blood vessel.
In a large vessel, a thrombus will adhere to the vessel wall and decrease the flow of blood, and is referred to as a mural thrombus.
In a small vessel, it may actually totally block the flow of blood and is termed an occlusive thrombus.
Thrombi are most commonly caused by vessel damage to the endothelial lining, which activates the clotting mechanism.
These may include venous stasis, when blood in the veins, particularly in the legs, remains stationary for long periods.
This is one of the dangers of long airplane flights in crowded conditions and may lead to deep vein thrombosis or atherosclerosis, an accumulation of debris in arteries.
Thrombophilia, alsocalledhypercoagulation,isaconditioninwhichthereisatendencytoformthrombosis.Thismaybefamilial(genetic) or acquired.
Acquired forms include the autoimmune disease lupus, immune reactions to heparin, polycythemia vera, thrombocytosis, sickle cell disease, pregnancy, and even obesity.

Whenaportionofathrombusbreaksfreefromthevesselwallandentersthecirculation,itisreferredtoasan embolus.
An embolus that is carried through the bloodstream can be large enough to block a vessel critical to a major organ.
When it becomes trapped, an embolus is called an embolism.
In the heart, brain, or lungs, an embolism may accordingly cause a heart attack, a stroke, or a pulmonary embolism.
These are medical emer gencies.
Amongthemanyknownbiochemicalactivitiesofaspirinisitsroleasananticoagulant.Aspirin(acetylsalicylicacid)is very effective at inhibiting the aggregation of platelets.
It is routinely administered during a heart attack or stroke to reduce the adverse effects.
Physicians sometimes recommend that patients at risk for cardiovascular disease take a low dose of aspirin on a daily basis as a preventivemeasure.
However, aspirin can also lead to serious side effects, including increasing the risk of ulcers.
A patient is well advised to consult a physician before beginning any aspirin regimen.
A class of drugs collectively known as thrombolytic agents can help speed up the degradation of an abnormal clot.
If a thrombolytic agent is administered to a patient within 3 hours following a thrombotic stroke, the patient‚Äôs prognosis improves significantly.
However, some strokes are not caused by thrombi, but by hemorrhage.
Thus, the cause must be determined before treatment begins.
Tissue plasminogen activator is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the primary enzyme that breaks down clots.
It is released naturally by endothelial cells but is also usedinclinicalmedicine.Newresearchisprogressingusingcompoundsisolatedfromthevenomofsomespeciesofsnakes, particularly vipers and cobras, which may eventually have therapeutic value as thrombolytic agents.
18.6|Blood Typing By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the two basic physiological consequences of transfusion of incompatible blood ‚Ä¢Compare and contrast ABO and Rh blood groups ‚Ä¢Identify which blood groups may be safely transfused into patients with dif ferent ABO types ‚Ä¢Discuss the pathophysiology of hemolytic disease of the newborn Blood transfusions in humans were risky procedures until the discovery of the major human blood groups by Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian biologist and physician, in 1900.
Until that point, physicians did not understand that death sometimes followed blood transfusions, when the type of donor blood infused into the patient was incompatible with the patient‚Äôs own blood.
Blood groups are determined by the presence or absence of specific marker molecules on the plasma membranes of erythrocytes.
With their discovery, it became possible for the first time to match patient-donor blood types and prevent transfusion reactions and deaths.
Antigens, Antibodies, and Transfusion Reactions Antigens are substances that the body does not recognize as belonging to the ‚Äúself‚Äù and that therefore trigger a defensive response from the leukocytes of the immune system.
(Seek more content for additional information on immunity.)
Here,762 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 we will focus on the role of immunity in blood transfusion reactions.
With RBCs in particular, you may see the antigens referred to as isoantigens or agglutinogens (surface antigens) and the antibodies referred to as isoantibodies or agglutinins.
In this chapter, we will use the more common terms antigens and antibodies.
Antigens are generally large proteins, but may include other classes of organic molecules, including carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.
Following an infusion of incompatible blood, erythrocytes with foreign antigens appear in the bloodstreamandtriggeranimmuneresponse.Proteinscalledantibodies(immunoglobulins),whichareproducedbycertain B lymphocytes called plasma cells, attach to the antigens on the plasma membranes of the infused erythrocytes and cause them to adhere to one another.
‚Ä¢Because the arms of the Y-shaped antibodies attach randomly to more than one nonself erythrocyte surface, they form clumps of erythrocytes.
This process is called agglutination.
‚Ä¢The clumps of erythrocytes block small blood vessels throughout the body , depriving tissues of oxygen and nutrients.
‚Ä¢As the erythrocyte clumps are degraded, in a process called hemolysis, their hemoglobin is released into the bloodstream.
This hemoglobin travels to the kidneys, which are responsible for filtration of the blood.
However, the loadofhemoglobinreleasedcaneasilyoverwhelmthekidney‚Äôscapacitytoclearit,andthepatientcanquicklydevelop kidney failure.
More than 50 antigens have been identified on erythrocyte membranes, but the most significant in terms of their potential harm to patients are classified in two groups: the ABO blood group and the Rh blood group.
The ABO Blood Group Althoughthe ABObloodgroup nameconsistsofthreeletters,ABObloodtypingdesignatesthepresenceorabsenceofjust two antigens, A and B.
Both are glycoproteins.
People whose erythrocytes have A antigens on their erythrocyte membrane surfacesaredesignatedbloodtypeA,andthosewhoseerythrocyteshaveBantigensarebloodtypeB.Peoplecanalsohave both A and B antigens on their erythrocytes, in which case they are blood type AB.
People with neither A nor B antigens are designated blood type O. ABO blood types are genetically determined.
Normally the body must be exposed to a foreign antigen before an antibody can be produced.
This is not the case for theABObloodgroup.IndividualswithtypeAblood‚Äîwithoutanypriorexposuretoincompatibleblood‚Äîhavepreformed antibodies to the B antigen circulating in their blood plasma.
These antibodies, referred to as anti-B antibodies, will cause agglutination and hemolysis if they ever encounter erythrocytes with B antigens.
Similarly, an individual with type B blood has pre-formed anti-A antibodies.
Individuals with type AB blood, which has both antigens, do not have preformed antibodies to either of these.
People with type O blood lack antigens A and B on their erythrocytes, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies circulate in their blood plasma.
Rh Blood Groups TheRh blood group is classified according to the presence or absence of a second erythrocyte antigen identified as Rh.
(It was first discovered in a type of primate known as a rhesus macaque, which is often used in research, because its blood is similar to that of humans.)
Although dozens of Rh antigens have been identified, only one, designated D, is clinically important.ThosewhohavetheRhDantigenpresentontheirerythrocytes‚Äîabout85percentofAmericans‚Äîaredescribed as Rh positive (Rh+) and those who lack it are Rh negative (Rh‚àí).
Note that the Rh group is distinct from the ABO group, so any individual, no matter their ABO blood type, may have or lack this Rh antigen.
When identifying a patient‚Äôs blood type, the Rh group is designated by adding the word positive or negative to the ABO type.
For example, A positive (A+) means ABO group A blood with the Rh antigen present, and AB negative (AB‚àí) means ABO group AB blood without the Rh antigen.
Table 18.2 summarizes the distribution of the ABO and Rh blood types within the United States.

This process, called sensitization, occurs following a transfusion with Rh- incompatible blood or, more commonly, with the birth of an Rh+baby to an Rh‚àímother.
Problems are rare in a first pregnancy, since the baby‚Äôs Rh+cells rarely cross the placenta (the organ of gas and nutrient exchange between the baby and the mother).
However, during or immediately after birth, the Rh‚àímother can be exposed to the baby‚Äôs Rh+cells (Figure 18.15 ).
Research has shown that this occurs in about 13‚àí14 percent of such pregnancies.
After exposure, the mother‚Äôs immune system begins to generate anti-Rh antibodies.
If the mother should then conceive another Rh+baby, the RhantibodiesshehasproducedcancrosstheplacentaintothefetalbloodstreamanddestroythefetalRBCs.Thiscondition, known as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) or erythroblastosis fetalis, may cause anemia in mild cases, but the agglutination and hemolysis can be so severe that without treatment the fetus may die in the womb or shortly after birth.764 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 18.15 Erythroblastosis Fetalis The first exposure of an Rh‚àímother to Rh+erythrocytes during pregnancy induces sensitization.
Anti-Rh antibodies begin to circulate in the mother‚Äôs bloodstream.
A second exposure occurs with a subsequent pregnancy with an Rh+fetus in the uterus.
Maternal anti-Rh antibodies may cross the placenta and enter the fetal bloodstream, causing agglutination and hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes.
AdrugknownasRhoGAM,shortforRhimmuneglobulin,cantemporarilypreventthedevelopmentofRhantibodies intheRh‚àímother,therebyavertingthispotentiallyseriousdiseaseforthefetus.RhoGAMantibodiesdestroyanyfetalRh+ erythrocytes that may cross the placental barrier.
RhoGAM is normally administered to Rh‚àímothers during weeks 26‚àí28 of pregnancy and within 72 hours following birth.
It has proven remarkably effective in decreasing the incidence of HDN.
Earlier we noted that the incidence of HDN in an Rh+subsequent pregnancy to an Rh‚àímother is about 13‚Äì14 percent without preventive treatment.
Since the introduction of RhoGAM in 1968, the incidence has dropped to about 0.1 percent in the United States.
ABO Cross Matching Clinicians are able to determine a patient‚Äôs blood type quickly and easily using commercially prepared antibodies.
In this laboratory test, called cross matching, a sample of blood of unknown type is placed into separate wells.
Into one well a small amount of anti-A antibody is added, and to another a small amount of anti-B antibody.
If the antigen is present, the antibodies will cause visible agglutination of the cells ( Figure 18.16 ).
The blood should also be tested for Rh antibodies.CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 765 Figure 18.16 Cross Matching Blood Types This sample of a commercially produced ‚Äúbedside‚Äù card enables quick typing of both a recipient‚Äôs and donor‚Äôs blood before transfusion.
The card contains three reaction sites or wells.
One is coated with an anti-A antibody, one with an anti-B antibody, and one with an anti-D antibody (tests for the presence of Rh factor D).
Mixing a drop of blood and saline into each well enables the blood to interact with a preparation of type-specific antibodies, also called anti-seras.
Agglutination of RBCs in a given site indicates a positive identification of the blood antigens, in this case A and Rh antigens for blood type A+.
For the purpose of transfusion, the donor‚Äôs and recipient‚Äôs blood types must match.
ABO Transfusion Protocols To avoid transfusion reactions, it is best to transfuse only matching blood types; that is, a type B+recipient should ideally receive blood only from a type B+donor and so on.
That said, in emergency situations, when acute hemorrhage threatens the patient‚Äôs life, there may not be time for cross matching to identify blood type.
In these cases, blood from a universal donor‚Äîan individual with type O‚àíblood‚Äîmay be transfused.
Recall that type O erythrocytes do not display A or B antigens.
Thus, anti-A or anti-B antibodies that might be circulating in the patient‚Äôs blood plasma will not encounter any erythrocyte surface antigens on the donated blood and therefore will not be provoked into a response.
One problem with this designation of universal donor is if the O‚àíindividual had prior exposure to Rh antigen, Rh antibodies may be present in the donated blood.
Also, introducing type O blood into an individual with type A, B, or AB blood will nevertheless introduce antibodies against both A and B antigens, as these are always circulating in the type O blood plasma.
This may causeproblemsfortherecipient,butbecausethevolumeofbloodtransfusedismuchlowerthanthevolumeofthepatient‚Äôs own blood, the adverse effects of the relatively few infused plasma antibodies are typically limited.
Rh factor also plays a role.
If Rh‚àíindividuals receiving blood have had prior exposure to Rh antigen, antibodies for this antigen may be present in the blood and trigger agglutination to some degree.
Although it is always preferable to cross match a patient‚Äôs blood before transfusing, in a true life-threatening emergency situation, this is not always possible, and these procedures may be implemented.
A patient with blood type AB+is known as the universal recipient .
This patient can theoretically receive any type of blood, because the patient‚Äôs own blood‚Äîhaving both A and B antigens on the erythrocyte surface‚Äîdoes not produce anti-A or anti-B antibodies.
In addition, an Rh+patient can receive both Rh+and Rh‚àíblood.
However, keep in mind that the donor‚Äôs blood will contain circulating antibodies, again with possible negative implications.
Figure 18.17 summarizes the blood types and compatibilities.
At the scene of multiple-vehicle accidents, military engagements, and natural or human-caused disasters, many victims may suffer simultaneously from acute hemorrhage, yet type O blood may not be immediately available.
In these circumstances,medicsmayatleasttrytoreplacesomeofthevolumeofbloodthathasbeenlost.Thisisdonebyintravenous administration of a saline solution that provides fluids and electrolytes in proportions equivalent to those of normal blood plasma.
Research is ongoing to develop a safe and effective artificial blood that would carry out the oxygen-carrying function of blood without the RBCs, enabling transfusions in the field without concern for incompatibility.
These blood substitutes normally contain hemoglobin- as well as perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers.766 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 18.17 ABO Blood Group This chart summarizes the characteristics of the blood types in the ABO blood group.

to defendthebodyagainstinfectionandotherthreats;andtothehomeostaticregulationofpH,temperature,andotherinternal conditions.
Blood is composed of formed elements‚Äîerythrocytes, leukocytes, and cell fragments called platelets‚Äîand a fluid extracellular matrix called plasma.
More than 90 percent of plasma is water.
The remainder is mostly plasmaCHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 771 proteins‚Äîmainly albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen‚Äîand other dissolved solutes such as glucose, lipids, electrolytes, and dissolvedgases.Becauseoftheformedelementsandtheplasmaproteinsandothersolutes,bloodisstickyandmoreviscous than water.
It is also slightly alkaline, and its temperature is slightly higher than normal body temperature.
18.2 Production of the Formed Elements Through the process of hemopoiesis, the formed elementsof blood are continuallyproduced, replacingthe relativelyshort- lived erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets.
Hemopoiesis begins in the red bone marrow, with hemopoietic stem cells that differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid lineages.
Myeloid stem cells give rise to most of the formed elements.
Lymphoid stem cells give rise only to the various lymphocytes designated as B and T cells, and NK cells.
Hemopoietic growth factors, including erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, colony-stimulating factors, and interleukins, promote the proliferation and differentiation of formed elements.
18.3 Erythrocytes The most abundant formed elements in blood, erythrocytes are red, biconcave disks packed with an oxygen-carrying compound called hemoglobin.
The hemoglobin molecule contains four globin proteins bound to a pigment molecule called heme, which contains an ion of iron.
In the bloodstream, iron picks up oxygen in the lungs and drops it off in the tissues; the amino acids in hemoglobin then transport carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.
Erythrocytes live only 120 days on average, and thus must be continually replaced.
Worn-out erythrocytes are phagocytized by macrophages and their hemoglobinisbrokendown.Thebreakdownproductsarerecycledorremovedaswastes:Globinisbrokendownintoamino acids for synthesis of new proteins; iron is stored in the liver or spleen or used by the bone marrow for production of new erythrocytes; and the remnants of heme are converted into bilirubin, or other waste products that are taken up by the liver and excreted in the bile or removed by the kidneys.
Anemia is a deficiency of RBCs or hemoglobin, whereas polycythemia is an excess of RBCs.
18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets Leukocytes function in body defenses.
They squeeze out of the walls of blood vessels through emigration or diapedesis, then may move through tissue fluid or become attached to various organs where they fight against pathogenic organisms, diseased cells, or other threats to health.
Granular leukocytes, which include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, originate with myeloid stem cells, as do the agranular monocytes.
The other agranular leukocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T cells,arisefromthelymphoidstemcellline.Themostabundantleukocytesaretheneutrophils,whicharefirstrespondersto infections,especiallywithbacteria.About20‚Äì30percentofallleukocytesarelymphocytes,whicharecriticaltothebody‚Äôs defenseagainstspecificthreats.Leukemiaandlymphomaaremalignanciesinvolvingleukocytes.Plateletsarefragmentsof cells known as megakaryocytes that dwell within the bone marrow.
While many platelets are stored in the spleen, others enter the circulation and are essential for hemostasis; they also produce several growth factors important for repair and healing.
18.5 Hemostasis Hemostasis is the physiological process by which bleeding ceases.
Hemostasis involves three basic steps: vascular spasm, theformationofaplateletplug,andcoagulation,inwhichclottingfactorspromotetheformationofafibrinclot.Fibrinolysis is the process in which a clot is degraded in a healing vessel.
Anticoagulants are substances that oppose coagulation.
They are important in limiting the extent and duration of clotting.
Inadequate clotting can result from too few platelets, or inadequate production of clotting factors, for instance, in the genetic disorder hemophilia.
Excessive clotting, called thrombosis,canbecausedbyexcessivenumbersofplatelets.Athrombusisacollectionoffibrin,platelets,anderythrocytes that has accumulated along the lining of a blood vessel, whereas an embolus is a thrombus that has broken free from the vessel wall and is circulating in the bloodstream.
18.6 Blood Typing Antigens are nonself molecules, usually large proteins, which provoke an immune response.
In transfusion reactions, antibodies attach to antigens on the surfaces of erythrocytes and cause agglutination and hemolysis.
ABO blood group antigens are designated A and B.
People with type A blood have A antigens on their erythrocytes, whereas those with type B blood have B antigens.
Those with AB blood have both A and B antigens, and those with type O blood have neither A norBantigens.Thebloodplasmacontainspreformedantibodiesagainsttheantigensnotpresentonaperson‚Äôserythrocytes.
A second group of blood antigens is the Rh group, the most important of which is Rh D. People with Rh‚àíblood do not have this antigen on their erythrocytes, whereas those who are Rh+do.
About 85 percent of Americans are Rh+.
When a woman who is Rh‚àíbecomes pregnant with an Rh+fetus, her body may begin to produce anti-Rh antibodies.
If she subsequently becomes pregnant with a second Rh+fetus and is not treated preventively with RhoGAM, the fetus will be at risk for an antigen-antibody reaction, including agglutination and hemolysis.
This is known as hemolytic disease of the newborn.772 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Cross matching to determine blood type is necessary before transfusing blood, unless the patient is experiencing hemorrhage that is an immediate threat to life, in which case type O‚àíblood may be transfused.

Lynch) Introduction Chapter Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify and describe the interior and exterior parts of the human heart ‚Ä¢Describe the path of blood through the cardiac circuits ‚Ä¢Describe the size, shape, and location of the heart ‚Ä¢Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle ‚Ä¢Explain the cardiac conduction system ‚Ä¢Describe the process and purpose of an electrocardiogram ‚Ä¢Explain the cardiac cycle ‚Ä¢Calculate cardiac outputCHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 777 ‚Ä¢Describe the effects of exercise on cardiac output and heart rate ‚Ä¢Name the centers of the brain that control heart rate and describe their function ‚Ä¢Identify other factors affecting heart rate ‚Ä¢Describe fetal heart development In this chapter, you will explore the remarkable pump that propels the blood into the vessels.
There is no single better word to describe the function of the heart other than ‚Äúpump,‚Äù since its contraction develops the pressure that ejects blood into the major vessels: the aorta and pulmonary trunk.
From these vessels, the blood is distributed to the remainder of the body.
Although the connotation of the term ‚Äúpump‚Äù suggests a mechanical device made of steel and plastic, the anatomical structure is a living, sophisticated muscle.
As you read this chapter, try to keep these twin concepts in mind: pump and muscle.
Althoughtheterm‚Äúheart‚ÄùisanEnglishword,cardiac(heart-related)terminologycanbetracedbacktotheLatinterm, ‚Äúkardia.‚Äù Cardiology is the study of the heart, and cardiologists are the physicians who deal primarily with the heart.
19.1|Heart Anatomy By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the location and position of the heart within the body cavity ‚Ä¢Describe the internal and external anatomy of the heart ‚Ä¢Identify the tissue layers of the heart ‚Ä¢Relate the structure of the heart to its function as a pump ‚Ä¢Compare systemic circulation to pulmonary circulation ‚Ä¢Identify the veins and arteries of the coronary circulation system ‚Ä¢Trace the pathway of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood thorough the chambers of the heart The vital importance of the heart is obvious.
If one assumes an average rate of contraction of 75 contractions per minute, a human heart would contract approximately 108,000 times in one day, more than 39 million times in one year, and nearly 3 billiontimesduringa75-yearlifespan.Eachofthemajorpumpingchambersoftheheartejectsapproximately70mLblood per contraction in a resting adult.
This would be equal to 5.25 liters of fluid per minute and approximately 14,000 liters per day.
Over one year, that would equal 10,000,000 liters or 2.6 million gallons of blood sent through roughly 60,000 miles of vessels.
In order to understand how that happens, it is necessary to understand the anatomy and physiology of the heart.
Location of the Heart The human heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the space known as the mediastinum.
Figure 19.2 shows the position of the heart within the thoracic cavity.
Within the mediastinum, the heart is separated from theothermediastinalstructuresbyatoughmembraneknownasthepericardium,orpericardialsac,andsitsinitsownspace called the pericardial cavity.
The dorsal surface of the heart lies near the bodies of the vertebrae, and its anterior surface sits deep to the sternum and costal cartilages.
The great veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the great arteries, the aorta and pulmonary trunk, are attached to the superior surface of the heart, called the base.
The base of the heart is locatedatthelevelofthethirdcostalcartilage,asseenin Figure19.2 .Theinferiortipoftheheart,theapex,liesjusttothe leftofthesternumbetweenthejunctionofthefourthandfifthribsneartheirarticulationwiththecostalcartilages.Theright side of the heart is deflected anteriorly, and the left side is deflected posteriorly.
It is important to remember the position and orientation of the heart when placing a stethoscope on the chest of a patient and listening for heart sounds, and also when looking at images taken from a midsagittal perspective.
The slight deviation of the apex to the left is reflected in a depression in the medial surface of the inferior lobe of the left lung, called the cardiac notch.778 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 19.2 Position of the Heart in the Thorax The heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the mediastinum.
It is about the size of a fist, is broad at the top, and tapers toward the base.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 779 CPR The position of the heart in the torso between the vertebrae and sternum (see Figure 19.2 for the position of the heart within the thorax) allows for individuals to apply an emergency technique known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if the heart of a patient should stop.
By applying pressure with the flat portion of one hand on the sternum in the area between the line at T4 and T9 (Figure 19.3), it is possible to manually compress the blood within the heart enoughtopushsomeofthebloodwithinitintothepulmonaryandsystemiccircuits.Thisisparticularlycriticalforthe brain, as irreversible damage and death of neurons occur within minutes of loss of blood flow.
Current standards call for compression of the chest at least 5 cm deep and at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, a rate equal to the beat in ‚ÄúStaying Alive,‚Äù recorded in 1977 by the Bee Gees.
If you are unfamiliar with this song, a version is available on www.youtube.com.Atthisstage,theemphasisisonperforminghigh-qualitychestcompressions,ratherthanproviding artificial respiration.
CPR is generally performed until the patient regains spontaneous contraction or is declared dead by an experienced healthcare professional.
Whenperformedbyuntrainedoroverzealousindividuals,CPRcanresultinbrokenribsorabrokensternum,and caninflictadditionalseveredamageonthepatient.Itisalsopossible,ifthehandsareplacedtoolowonthesternum,to manually drive the xiphoid process into the liver, a consequence that may prove fatal for the patient.
Proper training is essential.
This proven life-sustaining technique is so valuable that virtually all medical personnel as well as concerned members of the public should be certified and routinely recertified in its application.
CPR courses are offered at a variety of locations, including colleges, hospitals, the American Red Cross, and some commercial companies.
They normally include practice of the compression technique on a mannequin.
Figure 19.3 CPR Technique If the heart should stop, CPR can maintain the flow of blood until the heart resumes beating.
By applying pressure to the sternum, the blood within the heart will be squeezed out of the heart and into the circulation.
Proper positioning of the hands on the sternum to perform CPR would be between the lines at T4 and T9.780 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Visit the American Heart Association website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/AHA) to help locate a course near your home in the United States.
There are also many other national and regional heart associations that offer the same service, depending upon the location.
Shape and Size of the Heart The shape of the heart is similar to a pinecone, rather broad at the superior surface and tapering to the apex (see Figure 19.2).
A typical heart is approximately the size of your fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in) in thickness.
Given the size difference between most members of the sexes, the weight of a female heart is approximately 250‚Äì300 grams (9 to 11 ounces), and the weight of a male heart is approximately 300‚Äì350 grams (11 to 12 ounces).
The heart of a well-trained athlete, especially one specializing in aerobic sports, can be considerably larger than this.
Cardiac muscle responds to exercise in a manner similar to that of skeletal muscle.
That is, exercise results in the addition of protein myofilaments that increase the size of the individual cells without increasing their numbers, a concept called hypertrophy.
Hearts of athletes can pump blood more effectively at lower rates than those of nonathletes.
Enlarged hearts are not always a result of exercise; they can result from pathologies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
The cause of an abnormally enlarged heart muscle is unknown, but the condition is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in apparently otherwise healthy young people.
Chambers and Circulation through the Heart The human heart consists of four chambers: The left side and the right side each have one atriumand oneventricle.
Each of the upper chambers, the right atrium (plural = atria) and the left atrium, acts as a receiving chamber and contracts to push blood into the lower chambers, the right ventricle and the left ventricle.
The ventricles serve as the primary pumping chambers of the heart, propelling blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body .
Therearetwodistinctbutlinkedcircuitsinthehumancirculationcalledthepulmonaryandsystemiccircuits.Although both circuits transport blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits from the point of view of gases.
Thepulmonary circuit transports blood to and from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and delivers carbon dioxide for exhalation.The systemiccircuit transportsoxygenatedbloodtovirtuallyallofthetissuesofthebodyandreturnsrelatively deoxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the heart to be sent back to the pulmonary circulation.
Therightventriclepumpsdeoxygenatedbloodintothe pulmonarytrunk,whichleadstowardthelungsandbifurcates into the left and right pulmonary arteries .
These vessels in turn branch many times before reaching the pulmonary capillaries , where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters.
The pulmonary trunk arteries and their branches are the only arteries in the post-natal body that carry relatively deoxygenated blood.
Highly oxygenated blood returning from the pulmonary capillaries in the lungs passes through a series of vessels that join together to form the pulmonaryveins‚Äîtheonlypost-natalveinsinthebodythatcarryhighlyoxygenatedblood.Thepulmonaryveinsconduct blood into the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit.
Eventually, these vessels will lead to the systemic capillaries, where exchange with the tissue fluid and cells of the body occurs.
In this case, oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the blood.
The blood exiting the systemic capillaries is lower in oxygen concentration than when it entered.
The capillaries will ultimately unite to form venules, joining to form ever-larger veins, eventually flowing into the two major systemic veins, thesuperior vena cava and theinferior vena cava, which return blood to the right atrium.
The blood in the superior and inferior venae cavae flows into the right atrium, which pumps blood into the right ventricle.
This process of blood circulation continues as long as the individual remains alive.
Understanding the flow of blood through the pulmonary and systemic circuits is critical to all health professions ( Figure 19.4 ).CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 781 Figure 19.4 Dual System of the Human Blood Circulation Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, where it is pumped into the pulmonary circuit.
The blood in the pulmonary artery branches is low in oxygen but relatively high in carbon dioxide.
Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out), and blood high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium.
From here, blood enters the left ventricle, which pumps it into the systemic circuit.
Following exchange in the systemic capillaries (oxygen and nutrients out of the capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), blood returns to the right atrium and the cycle is repeated.
Membranes, Surface Features, and Layers Our exploration of more in-depth heart structures begins by examining the membrane that surrounds the heart, the prominent surface features of the heart, and the layers that form the wall of the heart.
Each of these components plays its own unique role in terms of function.
Membranes The membrane that directly surrounds the heart and defines the pericardial cavity is called the pericardium orpericardial sac.Italsosurroundsthe‚Äúroots‚Äùofthemajorvessels,ortheareasofclosestproximitytotheheart.Thepericardium,which literally translates as ‚Äúaround the heart,‚Äù consists of two distinct sublayers: the sturdy outer fibrous pericardium and the inner serous pericardium.
The fibrous pericardium is made of tough, dense connective tissue that protects the heart and maintains its position in the thorax.
The more delicate serous pericardium consists of two layers: the parietal pericardium, which is fused to the fibrous pericardium, and an inner visceral pericardium, or epicardium, which is fused to the heart and is part of the heart wall.
The pericardial cavity, filled with lubricating serous fluid, lies between the epicardium and the pericardium.782 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 In most organs within the body, visceral serous membranes such as the epicardium are microscopic.
However, in the case of the heart, it is not a microscopic layer but rather a macroscopic layer, consisting of a simple squamous epithelium called amesothelium, reinforced with loose, irregular, or areolar connective tissue that attaches to the pericardium.
This mesothelium secretes the lubricating serous fluid that fills the pericardial cavity and reduces friction as the heart contracts.
Figure 19.5 illustrates the pericardial membrane and the layers of the heart.
Figure 19.5 Pericardial Membranes and Layers of the Heart Wall The pericardial membrane that surrounds the heart consists of three layers and the pericardial cavity.
The heart wall also consists of three layers.
The pericardial membrane and the heart wall share the epicardium.
Heart: Cardiac Tamponade If excess fluid builds within the pericardial space, it can lead to a condition called cardiac tamponade, or pericardial tamponade.
With each contraction of the heart, more fluid‚Äîin most instances, blood‚Äîaccumulates within the pericardialcavity.Inordertofillwithbloodforthenextcontraction,theheartmustrelax.However,theexcessfluidin the pericardial cavity puts pressure on the heart and prevents full relaxation, so the chambers within the heart contain slightly less blood as they begin each heart cycle.
Over time, less and less blood is ejected from the heart.
If the fluid builds up slowly, as in hypothyroidism, the pericardial cavity may be able to expand gradually to accommodate this extra volume.
Some cases of fluid in excess of one liter within the pericardial cavity have been reported.
Rapid accumulation of as little as 100 mL of fluid following trauma may trigger cardiac tamponade.
Other common causes includemyocardialrupture,pericarditis,cancer,orevencardiacsurgery.Removalofthisexcessfluidrequiresinsertion ofdrainagetubesintothepericardialcavity.Prematureremovalofthesedrainagetubes,forexample,followingcardiac surgery, or clot formation within these tubes are causes of this condition.
Untreated, cardiac tamponade can lead to death.
Surface Features of the Heart Inside the pericardium, the surface features of the heart are visible, including the four chambers.

Also prominent is a series of fat-filled grooves, each of which is known as a sulcus(plural = sulci), along the superior surfaces of the heart.
Major coronary blood vessels are located in these sulci.
The deep coronary sulcus is located between the atria and ventricles.
Located between the left and right ventricles are two additional sulci that are not asdeepasthecoronarysulcus.The anteriorinterventricularsulcus isvisibleontheanteriorsurfaceoftheheart,whereasCHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 783 theposterior interventricular sulcus is visible on the posterior surface of the heart.
Figure 19.6 illustrates anterior and posterior views of the surface of the heart.
Figure 19.6 External Anatomy of the Heart Inside the pericardium, the surface features of the heart are visible.
Layers The wall of the heart is composed of three layers of unequal thickness.
From superficial to deep, these are the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium (see Figure 19.5 ).
The outermost layer of the wall of the heart is also the innermost layer of the pericardium, the epicardium, or the visceral pericardium discussed earlier .
The middle and thickest layer is the myocardium, made largely of cardiac muscle cells.
It is built upon a framework of collagenous fibers, plus the blood vessels that supply the myocardium and the nerve fibers that help regulate the heart.
It is the contraction of the myocardium that pumps blood through the heart and into the major arteries.
The muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart.
They form a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels.
Deeper ventricular muscles also form a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex.
More superficial layers of ventricular muscle wrap around both ventricles.
This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively than a simple linear pattern would.
Figure 19.7 illustrates the arrangement of muscle cells.784 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 19.7 Heart Musculature The swirling pattern of cardiac muscle tissue contributes significantly to the heart‚Äôs ability to pump blood effectively.
Although the ventricles on the right and left sides pump the same amount of blood per contraction, the muscle of the left ventricle is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle.
In order to overcome the high resistance required to pump blood into the long systemic circuit, the left ventricle must generate a great amount of pressure.
The right ventricle does not need to generate as much pressure, since the pulmonary circuit is shorter and provides less resistance.
Figure 19.8 illustrates the differences in muscular thickness needed for each of the ventricles.
Figure 19.8 Differences in Ventricular Muscle Thickness The myometrium in the left ventricle is significantly thicker than that of the right ventricle.
Both ventricles pump the same amount of blood, but the left ventricle must generate a much greater pressure to overcome greater resistance in the systemic circuit.
The ventricles are shown in both relaxed and contracting states.
Note the differences in the relative size of the lumens, the region inside each ventricle where the blood is contained.
The innermost layer of the heart wall, the endocardium, is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue.
The endocardium lines the chambers where the blood circulates and covers the heart valves.
It is made of simple squamous epithelium called endothelium, which is continuous with the endothelial lining of the blood vessels (see Figure 19.5).
Once regarded as a simple lining layer, recent evidence indicates that the endothelium of the endocardium and the coronary capillaries may play active roles in regulating the contraction of the muscle within the myocardium.
The endothelium may also regulate the growth patterns of the cardiac muscle cells throughout life, and the endothelins it secretescreateanenvironmentinthesurroundingtissuefluidsthatregulatesionicconcentrationsandstatesofcontractility.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 785 Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictors and, in a normal individual, establish a homeostatic balance with other vasoconstrictors and vasodilators.
Internal Structure of the Heart Recall that the heart‚Äôs contraction cycle follows a dual pattern of circulation‚Äîthe pulmonary and systemic circuits‚Äîbecause of the pairs of chambers that pump blood into the circulation.
In order to develop a more precise understanding of cardiac function, it is first necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures in more detail.
Septa of the Heart The word septum is derived from the Latin for ‚Äúsomething that encloses;‚Äù in this case, a septum(plural = septa) refers to a wall or partition that divides the heart into chambers.
The septa are physical extensions of the myocardium lined with endocardium.
Located between the two atria is the interatrial septum .
Normally in an adult heart, the interatrial septum bearsanoval-shapeddepressionknownasthe fossaovalis,aremnantofanopeninginthefetalheartknownasthe foramen ovale.
The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the pulmonary circuit.
Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern.
Between the two ventricles is a second septum known as the interventricular septum.
Unlike the interatrial septum, theinterventricularseptumisnormallyintactafteritsformationduringfetaldevelopment.Itissubstantiallythickerthanthe interatrial septum, since the ventricles generate far greater pressure when they contract.
The septum between the atria and ventricles is known as the atrioventricular septum.
It is marked by the presence of four openings that allow blood to move from the atria into the ventricles and from the ventricles into the pulmonary trunk and aorta.
Located in each of these openings between the atria and ventricles is a valve, a specialized structure that ensures one-way flow of blood.
The valves between the atria and ventricles are known generically as atrioventricular valves.
The valves at the openings that lead to the pulmonary trunk and aorta are known generically as semilunar valves.
The interventricular septum is visible in Figure 19.9.
In this figure, the atrioventricular septum has been removed to better show the bicupid and tricuspid valves; the interatrial septum is not visible, since its location is covered by the aorta and pulmonary trunk.
Since these openings and valves structurally weaken the atrioventricular septum, the remaining tissue is heavily reinforced with dense connective tissue called the cardiac skeleton, or skeleton of the heart.

As much as 20‚Äì25 percent of the general population may have a patent foramenovale,butfortunately,mosthavethebenign,asymptomaticversion.Patentforamenovaleisnormallydetected by auscultation of a heart murmur (an abnormal heart sound) and confirmed by imaging with an echocardiogram.
Despite its prevalence in the general population, the causes of patent ovale are unknown, and there are no known risk factors.Innonlife-threateningcases,itisbettertomonitortheconditionthantoriskheartsurgerytorepairandsealthe opening.
Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormal narrowing of the aorta that is normally located at the insertion of the ligamentum arteriosum, the remnant of the fetal shunt called the ductus arteriosus.
If severe, this condition drastically restricts blood flow through the primary systemic artery, which is life threatening.
In some individuals, the condition may be fairly benign and not detected until later in life.
Detectable symptoms in an infant include difficulty breathing,poorappetite,troublefeeding,orfailuretothrive.Inolderindividuals,symptomsincludedizziness,fainting, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and nosebleeds.
Treatment involves surgery to resect (remove) the affected region or angioplasty to open the abnormally narrow passageway.
Studies have shown that the earlier the surgery is performed, the better the chance of survival.
A patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close.
The condition may range from severe to benign.
Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close results in blood flowing from the higher pressure aorta into the lower pressure pulmonary trunk.
This additional fluid moving toward the lungs increases pulmonary pressure and makes respiration difficult.
Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia, enlarged heart, a widened pulse pressure, and poor weight gain in infants.
Treatments include surgical closure (ligation), manual closure using platinum coils or specialized mesh inserted via the femoral artery or vein, or nonsteroidalanti-inflammatorydrugstoblockthesynthesisofprostaglandinE2,whichmaintainsthevesselinanopen position.
If untreated, the condition can result in congestive heart failure.
Septal defects are not uncommon in individuals and may be congenital or caused by various disease processes.
Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital condition that may also occur from exposure to unknown environmental factors; it occurs when there is an opening in the interventricular septum caused by blockage of the pulmonary trunk, normally at the pulmonary semilunar valve.
This allows blood that is relatively low in oxygen from the right ventricle to flow into the left ventricle and mix with the blood that is relatively high in oxygen.
Symptoms include a distinct heart murmur,lowbloodoxygenpercentsaturation,dyspneaordifficultyinbreathing,polycythemia,broadening(clubbing) of the fingers and toes, and in children, difficulty in feeding or failure to grow and develop.
It is the most common causeofcyanosisfollowingbirth.Theterm‚Äútetralogy‚Äùisderivedfromthefourcomponentsofthecondition,although only three may be present in an individual patient: pulmonary infundibular stenosis (rigidity of the pulmonary valve), overriding aorta (the aorta is shifted above both ventricles), ventricular septal defect (opening), and right ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement of the right ventricle).
Other heart defects may also accompany this condition, which is typically confirmed by echocardiography imaging.
Tetralogy of Fallot occurs in approximately 400 out of one million live births.
Normal treatment involves extensive surgical repair, including the use of stents to redirect blood flow and replacementofvalvesandpatchestorepairtheseptaldefect,buttheconditionhasarelativelyhighmortality.Survival rates are currently 75 percent during the first year of life; 60 percent by 4 years of age; 30 percent by 10 years; and 5 percent by 40 years.
In the case of severe septal defects, including both tetralogy of Fallot and patent foramen ovale, failure of the heart to develop properly can lead to a condition commonly known as a ‚Äúblue baby.‚Äù Regardless of normal skin pigmentation,individualswiththisconditionhaveaninsufficientsupplyofoxygenatedblood,whichleadstocyanosis, a blue or purple coloration of the skin, especially when active.
Septaldefectsarecommonlyfirst detectedthrough auscultation,listeningto thechestusing a stethoscope.In this case, instead of hearing normal heart sounds attributed to the flow of blood and closing of heart valves, unusual heart sounds may be detected.
This is often followed by medical imaging to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.
In many cases, treatment may not be needed.
Some common congenital heart defects are illustrated in Figure 19.10 .CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 787 Figure 19.10 Congenital Heart Defects (a) A patent foramen ovale defect is an abnormal opening in the interatrial septum, or more commonly, a failure of the foramen ovale to close.

Right Atrium The right atrium serves as the receiving chamber for blood returning to the heart from the systemic circulation.
The two major systemic veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the large coronary vein called the coronary sinus that drains the heart myocardium empty into the right atrium.
The superior vena cava drains blood from regions superior to the diaphragm: the head, neck, upper limbs, and the thoracic region.
It empties into the superior and posterior portions of the rightatrium.Theinferiorvenacavadrainsbloodfromareasinferiortothediaphragm:thelowerlimbsandabdominopelvic regionofthebody.It,too,emptiesintotheposteriorportionoftheatria,butinferiortotheopeningofthesuperiorvenacava.

The opening between the atrium and ventricle is guarded by the tricuspid valve.
Right Ventricle The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve.
Each flap of the valve is attached to strong strands of connective tissue, the chordae tendineae, literally ‚Äútendinous cords,‚Äù or sometimes more poetically referred to as ‚Äúheart strings.‚Äù There are several chordae tendineae associated with each of the flaps.
They are composed of approximately 80 percent collagenous fibers with the remainder consisting of elastic fibers and endothelium.
They connect each of the flaps to a papillary muscle that extends from the inferior ventricular surface.
There are three papillary muscles intherightventricle,calledtheanterior,posterior,andseptalmuscles,whichcorrespondtothethreesectionsofthevalves.
When the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, pressure within the ventricular chamber rises.
Blood, like any fluid, flowsfromhigherpressuretolowerpressureareas,inthiscase,towardthepulmonarytrunkandtheatrium.Topreventany potentialbackflow,thepapillarymusclesalsocontract,generatingtensiononthechordaetendineae.Thispreventstheflaps ofthevalvesfrombeingforcedintotheatriaandregurgitationofthebloodbackintotheatriaduringventricularcontraction.

(credit: modification of work by ‚ÄúPV KS‚Äù/flickr.com) The walls of the ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium.
In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band (seeFigure19.9)reinforcesthethinwallsoftherightventricleandplaysacrucialroleincardiacconduction.Itarisesfrom the inferior portion of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle.
When the right ventricle contracts, it ejects blood into the pulmonary trunk, which branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry it to each lung.
The superior surface of the right ventricle begins to taper as it approaches the pulmonary trunk.
At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve that prevents backflow from the pulmonary trunk.
Left Atrium After exchange of gases in the pulmonary capillaries, blood returns to the left atrium high in oxygen via one of the four pulmonary veins.
While the left atrium does not contain pectinate muscles, it does have an auricle that includes these pectinate ridges.
Blood flows nearly continuously from the pulmonary veins back into the atrium, which acts as the receivingchamber,andfromherethroughanopeningintotheleftventricle.Mostbloodflowspassivelyintotheheartwhile boththeatriaandventriclesarerelaxed,buttowardtheendoftheventricularrelaxationperiod,theleftatriumwillcontract, pumping blood into the ventricle.
This atrial contraction accounts for approximately 20 percent of ventricular filling.
The opening between the left atrium and ventricle is guarded by the mitral valve.
Left Ventricle Recall that, although both sides of the heart will pump the same amount of blood, the muscular layer is much thicker in the leftventriclecomparedtotheright(see Figure19.8).Liketherightventricle,theleftalsohastrabeculaecarneae,butthere is no moderator band.

Heart Valve Structure and Function A transverse section through the heart slightly above the level of the atrioventricular septum reveals all four heart valves along the same plane (Figure 19.12).
The valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart.
Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the right atrioventricular valve, or tricuspid valve.
It typically consists of three flaps, or leaflets, made of endocardium reinforced with additional connective tissue.
The flaps are connected by chordae tendineae to the papillary muscles, which control the opening and closing of the valves.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 789 Figure 19.12 Heart Valves With the atria and major vessels removed, all four valves are clearly visible, although it is difficult to distinguish the three separate cusps of the tricuspid valve.
Emerging from the right ventricle at the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve, or the pulmonary valve; it is also known as the pulmonic valve or the right semilunar valve.
The pulmonary valve is comprised of three small flaps of endothelium reinforced with connective tissue.
When the ventricle relaxes, the pressure differential causes blood to flow back into the ventricle from the pulmonary trunk.
This flow of blood fills the pocket-like flaps of the pulmonary valve, causing the valve to close and producing an audible sound.
Unlike the atrioventricular valves, there are no papillary muscles or chordae tendineae associated with the pulmonary valve.
Located at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve , also called the bicuspid valve or theleft atrioventricular valve.
Structurally, this valve consists of two cusps, known as the anterior medial cusp and the posterior medial cusp, compared to the three cusps of the tricuspid valve.
In a clinical setting, the valve is referred to as the mitral valve, rather than the bicuspid valve.
The two cusps of the mitral valve are attached by chordae tendineae to two papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle.
At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve, or the aortic valve, which prevents backflow from the aorta.
It normallyiscomposedofthreeflaps.Whentheventriclerelaxesandbloodattemptstoflowbackintotheventriclefromthe aorta, blood will fill the cusps of the valve, causing it to close and producing an audible sound.
InFigure 19.13 a, the two atrioventricular valves are open and the two semilunar valves are closed.
This occurs when both atria and ventricles are relaxed and when the atria contract to pump blood into the ventricles.
Figure 19.13b shows a frontal view.
Although only the left side of the heart is illustrated, the process is virtually identical on the right.790 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 19.13 Blood Flow from the Left Atrium to the Left Ventricle (a) A transverse section through the heart illustrates the four heart valves.

The atria and vessels have been removed.
(b) A frontal section through the heart illustrates blood flow through the mitral valve.
When the mitral valve is open, it allows blood to move from the left atrium to the left ventricle.
The aortic semilunar valve is closed to prevent backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle.
Figure19.14a showstheatrioventricularvalvesclosedwhilethetwosemilunarvalvesareopen.Thisoccurswhenthe ventricles contract to eject blood into the pulmonary trunk and aorta.
Closure of the two atrioventricular valves prevents blood from being forced back into the atria.
This stage can be seen from a frontal view in Figure 19.14 b.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 791 Figure 19.14 Blood Flow from the Left Ventricle into the Great Vessels (a) A transverse section through the heart illustrates the four heart valves during ventricular contraction.
The two atrioventricular valves are closed, but the two semilunar valves are open.
The atria and vessels have been removed.
(b) A frontal view shows the closed mitral (bicuspid) valve that prevents backflow of blood into the left atrium.
The aortic semilunar valve is open to allow blood to be ejected into the aorta.
When the ventricles begin to contract, pressure within the ventricles rises and blood flows toward the area of lowest pressure,whichisinitiallyintheatria.Thisbackflowcausesthecuspsofthetricuspidandmitral(bicuspid)valvestoclose.
Thesevalvesaretieddowntothepapillarymusclesbychordaetendineae.Duringtherelaxationphaseofthecardiaccycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight (see Figure 19.13b).
However, as the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, so do the papillary muscles.
This creates tension on the chordae tendineae (see Figure 19.14 b), helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria.
The aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves lack the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles associated with the atrioventricular valves.
Instead, they consist of pocket-like folds of endocardium reinforced with additional connective tissue.Whentheventriclesrelaxandthechangeinpressureforcesthebloodtowardtheventricles,thebloodpressesagainst these cusps and seals the openings.792 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/heartvalve) to observe an echocardiogram of actual heart valves opening andclosing.Althoughmuchofthehearthasbeen‚Äúremoved‚Äùfromthisgifloopsothechordaetendineaearenotvisible, why is their presence more critical for the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) than the semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) valves?
Heart Valves When heart valves do not function properly, they are often described as incompetent and result in valvular heart disease, which can range from benign to lethal.
Some of these conditions are congenital, that is, the individual was born with the defect, whereas others may be attributed to disease processes or trauma.
Some malfunctions are treated with medications, others require surgery, and still others may be mild enough that the condition is merely monitored since treatment might trigger more serious consequences.
Valvular disorders are often caused by carditis, or inflammation of the heart.
One common trigger for this inflammation is rheumatic fever, or scarlet fever, an autoimmune response to the presence of a bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenes , normally a disease of childhood.
While any of the heart valves may be involved in valve disorders, mitral regurgitation is the most common, detected in approximately 2 percent of the population, and the pulmonary semilunar valve is the least frequently involved.
When a valve malfunctions, the flow of blood to a region will often be disrupted.
The resulting inadequate flow of blood to this region will be described in general terms as an insufficiency.
The specific type of insufficiency is named for the valve involved: aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, tricuspid insufficiency, or pulmonary insufficiency.
If one of the cusps of the valve is forced backward by the force of the blood, the condition is referred to as a prolapsed valve.
Prolapse may occur if the chordae tendineae are damaged or broken, causing the closure mechanism tofail.Thefailureofthevalvetocloseproperlydisruptsthenormalone-wayflowofbloodandresultsinregurgitation, when the blood flows backward from its normal path.
Using a stethoscope, the disruption to the normal flow of blood produces a heart murmur.
Stenosis is a condition in which the heart valves become rigid and may calcify over time.

Occasionally, one or more of the chordae tendineae will tear or the papillary muscle itself may die as a component of a myocardial infarction (heart attack).
In this case, the patient‚Äôs condition will deteriorate dramatically and rapidly, and immediate surgical intervention may be required.
Auscultation, or listening to a patient‚Äôs heart sounds, is one of the most useful diagnostic tools, since it is proven, safe, and inexpensive.
The term auscultation is derived from the Latin for ‚Äúto listen,‚Äù and the technique has been used for diagnostic purposes as far back as the ancient Egyptians.
Valve and septal disorders will trigger abnormal heart sounds.
If a valvular disorder is detected or suspected, a test called an echocardiogram, or simply an ‚Äúecho,‚Äù may be ordered.Echocardiogramsaresonogramsoftheheartandcanhelpinthediagnosisofvalvedisordersaswellasawide variety of heart pathologies.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 793 Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/heartsounds) for a free download, including excellent animations and audio of heart sounds.
Cardiologist Cardiologists are medical doctors that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the heart.
After completing 4 years of medical school, cardiologists complete a three-year residency in internal medicine followed by an additional three or more years in cardiology.
Following this 10-year period of medical training and clinical experience, they qualify for a rigorous two-day examination administered by the Board of Internal Medicine that tests their academic training and clinical abilities, including diagnostics and treatment.
After successful completion of this examination, a physician becomes a board-certified cardiologist.
Some board-certified cardiologists may be invited to become a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology (FACC).

Coronary Circulation You will recall that the heart is a remarkable pump composed largely of cardiac muscle cells that are incredibly active throughout life.
Like all other cells, a cardiomyocyte requires a reliable supply of oxygen and nutrients, and a way to removewastes,soitneedsadedicated,complex,andextensivecoronarycirculation.Andbecauseofthecriticalandnearly ceaseless activity of the heart throughout life, this need for a blood supply is even greater than for a typical cell.
However, coronarycirculationisnotcontinuous;rather,itcycles,reachingapeakwhentheheartmuscleisrelaxedandnearlyceasing while it is contracting.
Coronary Arteries Coronary arteries supply blood to the myocardium and other components of the heart.
The first portion of the aorta after it arises from the left ventricle gives rise to the coronary arteries.
There are three dilations in the wall of the aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve.
Two of these, the left posterior aortic sinus and anterior aortic sinus, give rise to the left and right coronary arteries, respectively.
The third sinus, the right posterior aortic sinus, typically does not give rise to a vessel.
Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the artery and follow the sulci are called epicardial coronary arteries .
The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the interventricular septum.
The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to the left.
Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery.
The larger anterior interventricular artery, also known as the left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising from the left coronary artery.
It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk.
Along the way it gives rise to numerous smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery, forming anastomoses.
An anastomosis isanareawherevesselsunitetoforminterconnectionsthatnormallyallowbloodtocirculatetoaregioneven if there may be partial blockage in another branch.
The anastomoses in the heart are very small.
Therefore, this ability is somewhat restricted in the heart so a coronary artery blockage often results in death of the cells (myocardial infarction) supplied by the particular vessel.
Therightcoronaryarteryproceedsalongthecoronarysulcusanddistributesbloodtotherightatrium,portionsofboth ventricles, and the heart conduction system.
Normally, one or more marginal arteries arise from the right coronary arteryCHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 795 inferior to the right atrium.
The marginal arteries supply blood to the superficial portions of the right ventricle.
On the posterior surface of the heart, the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior interventricular artery, also known as theposteriordescendingartery.Itrunsalongtheposteriorportionoftheinterventricularsulcustowardtheapexoftheheart, giving rise to branches that supply the interventricular septum and portions of both ventricles.
Figure 19.15 presents views of the coronary circulation from both the anterior and posterior views.

The posterior view of the heart shows the prominent coronary surface vessels.796 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Heart: Myocardial Infarction Myocardial infarction (MI) is the formal term for what is commonly referred to as a heart attack.
It normally results from a lack of blood flow (ischemia) and oxygen (hypoxia) to a region of the heart, resulting in death of the cardiac musclecells.AnMIoftenoccurswhenacoronaryarteryisblockedbythebuildupofatheroscleroticplaqueconsisting oflipids,cholesterolandfattyacids,andwhitebloodcells,primarilymacrophages.Itcanalsooccurwhenaportionof anunstableatheroscleroticplaquetravelsthroughthecoronaryarterialsystemandlodgesinoneofthesmallervessels.
The resulting blockage restricts the flow of blood and oxygen to the myocardium and causes death of the tissue.
MIs may be triggered by excessive exercise, in which the partially occluded artery is no longer able to pump sufficient quantities of blood, or severe stress, which may induce spasm of the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel.
In the case of acute MI, there is often sudden pain beneath the sternum (retrosternal pain) called angina pectoris, often radiating down the left arm in males but not in female patients.
Until this anomaly between the sexes was discovered, many female patients suffering MIs were misdiagnosed and sent home.
In addition, patients typically present with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath (dyspnea), irregular heartbeat (palpations), nausea and vomiting, sweating (diaphoresis), anxiety, and fainting (syncope), although not all of these symptoms may be present.
Many of the symptoms are shared with other medical conditions, including anxiety attacks and simple indigestion, so differential diagnosis is critical.
It is estimated that between 22 and 64 percent of MIs present without any symptoms.
An MI can be confirmed by examining the patient‚Äôs ECG, which frequently reveals alterations in the ST and Q components.
Some classification schemes of MI are referred to as ST-elevated MI (STEMI) and non-elevated MI (non-STEMI).
In addition, echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be employed.
Common blood tests indicating an MI include elevated levels of creatine kinase MB (an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of creatine to phosphocreatine, consuming ATP) and cardiac troponin (the regulatory protein for muscle contraction), both of which are released by damaged cardiac muscle cells.
Immediate treatments for MI are essential and include administering supplemental oxygen, aspirin that helps to break up clots, and nitroglycerine administered sublingually (under the tongue) to facilitate its absorption.
Despite its unquestioned success in treatments and use since the 1880s, the mechanism of nitroglycerine is still incompletely understood but is believed to involve the release of nitric oxide, a known vasodilator, and endothelium-derived releasingfactor,whichalsorelaxesthesmoothmuscleinthetunicamediaofcoronaryvessels.Longer-termtreatments includeinjectionsofthrombolyticagentssuchasstreptokinasethatdissolvetheclot,theanticoagulantheparin,balloon angioplastyandstentstoopenblockedvessels,andbypasssurgerytoallowbloodtopassaroundthesiteofblockage.If thedamageisextensive,coronaryreplacementwithadonorheartorcoronaryassistdevice,asophisticatedmechanical device that supplements the pumping activity of the heart, may be employed.
Despite the attention, development of artificial hearts to augment the severely limited supply of heart donors has proven less than satisfactory but will likely improve in the future.
MIs may trigger cardiac arrest, but the two are not synonymous.
Important risk factors for MI include cardiovasculardisease,age,smoking,highbloodlevelsofthelow-densitylipoprotein(LDL,oftenreferredtoas‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol), low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, lack of physical exercise, chronic kidney disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and use of illegal drugs.
Coronary Veins Coronary veins drain the heart and generally parallel the large surface arteries (see Figure 19.15).
The great cardiac veincan be seen initially on the surface of the heart following the interventricular sulcus, but it eventually flows along the coronary sulcus into the coronary sinus on the posterior surface.
The great cardiac vein initially parallels the anterior interventriculararteryanddrainstheareassuppliedbythisvessel.Itreceivesseveralmajorbranches,includingtheposterior cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, and the small cardiac vein.
The posterior cardiac vein parallels and drains the areas supplied by the marginal artery branch of the circumflex artery.
The middle cardiac vein parallels and drains the areas supplied by the posterior interventricular artery.
The small cardiac vein parallels the right coronary artery and drains the blood from the posterior surfaces of the right atrium and ventricle.
The coronary sinus is a large, thin-walled vein on the posterior surface of the heart lying within the atrioventricular sulcus and emptying directly into the right atrium.
The anterior cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac arteries and drain the anterior surface of the right ventricle.
Unlike these other cardiac veins, it bypasses the coronary sinus and drains directly into the right atrium.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 797 Heart: Coronary Artery Disease Coronaryarterydiseaseistheleadingcauseofdeathworldwide.Itoccurswhenthebuildupofplaque‚Äîafattymaterial including cholesterol, connective tissue, white blood cells, and some smooth muscle cells‚Äîwithin the walls of the arteries obstructs the flow of blood and decreases the flexibility or compliance of the vessels.
This condition is called atherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries that involves the accumulation of plaque.
As the coronary blood vessels become occluded, the flow of blood to the tissues will be restricted, a condition called ischemia that causes the cells to receive insufficient amounts of oxygen, called hypoxia.
Figure 19.16 shows the blockage of coronary arteries highlighted by the injection of dye.
Some individuals with coronary artery disease report pain radiating from the chest called angina pectoris, but others remain asymptomatic.
If untreated, coronary artery disease can lead to MI or a heart attack.
Figure 19.16 Atherosclerotic Coronary Arteries In this coronary angiogram (X-ray), the dye makes visible two occluded coronary arteries.
Such blockages can lead to decreased blood flow (ischemia) and insufficient oxygen (hypoxia) delivered to the cardiac tissues.
If uncorrected, this can lead to cardiac muscle death (myocardial infarction).
The disease progresses slowly and often begins in children and can be seen as fatty ‚Äústreaks‚Äù in the vessels.
It thengraduallyprogressesthroughoutlife.Well-documentedriskfactorsincludesmoking,familyhistory,hypertension, obesity, diabetes, high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, stress, and hyperlipidemia or high circulating levels of lipids in the blood.
Treatments may include medication, changes to diet and exercise, angioplasty with a balloon catheter, insertion of a stent, or coronary bypass procedure.

Then, the balloon is deflated and retracted.
A stent consisting of a specialized mesh is typically inserted at the site of occlusion to reinforce the weakened and damaged walls.
Stent insertions have been routine in cardiology for more than 40 years.
Coronary bypass surgery may also be performed.
This surgical procedure grafts a replacement vessel obtained from another, less vital portion of the body to bypass the occluded area.
This procedure is clearly effective in treating patients experiencing a MI, but overall does not increase longevity.
Nor does it seem advisable in patients with stable798 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 althoughdiminishedcardiaccapacitysincefrequentlylossofmentalacuityoccursfollowingtheprocedure.Long-term changes to behavior, emphasizing diet and exercise plus a medicine regime tailored to lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol and lipids, and reduce clotting are equally as effective.

Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to initiate an electrical potential at a fixed rate that spreads rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contractile mechanism.
This property is known as autorhythmicity.
Neithersmoothnorskeletalmusclecandothis.Eventhoughcardiacmusclehasautorhythmicity,heartrateismodulatedby the endocrine and nervous systems.
There are two major types of cardiac muscle cells: myocardial contractile cells and myocardial conducting cells.
The myocardialcontractilecells constitutethebulk(99percent)ofthecellsintheatriaandventricles.Contractilecellsconduct impulses and are responsible for contractions that pump blood through the body.
The myocardial conducting cells (1 percent of the cells) form the conduction system of the heart.
Except for Purkinje cells, they are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or filaments needed for contraction.
Their function is similar in manyrespectstoneurons,althoughtheyarespecializedmusclecells.Myocardialconductioncellsinitiateandpropagatethe action potential (the electrical impulse) that travels throughout the heart and triggers the contractions that propel the blood.
Structure of Cardiac Muscle Compared to the giant cylinders of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are considerably shorter with much smaller diameters.
Cardiac muscle also demonstrates striations, the alternating pattern of dark A bands and light I bandsattributedtotheprecisearrangementofthemyofilamentsandfibrilsthatareorganizedinsarcomeresalongthelength of the cell (Figure 19.17a).
These contractile elements are virtually identical to skeletal muscle.
T (transverse) tubules penetrate from the surface plasma membrane, the sarcolemma, to the interior of the cell, allowing the electrical impulse to reach the interior.
The T tubules are only found at the Z discs, whereas in skeletal muscle, they are found at the junction of the A and I bands.
Therefore, there are one-half as many T tubules in cardiac muscle as in skeletal muscle.
In addition, the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores few calcium ions, so most of the calcium ions must come from outside the cells.
The result is a slower onset of contraction.
Mitochondria are plentiful, providing energy for the contractions of the heart.
Typically, cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus, but two or more nuclei may be found in some cells.
Cardiac muscle cells branch freely.
A junction between two adjoining cells is marked by a critical structure called an intercalateddisc,whichhelpssupportthesynchronizedcontractionofthemuscle(Figure19.17b).Thesarcolemmasfrom adjacent cells bind together at the intercalated discs.
They consist of desmosomes, specialized linking proteoglycans, tight junctions, and large numbers of gap junctions that allow the passage of ions between the cells and help to synchronize the contraction(Figure19.17c ).Intercellularconnectivetissuealsohelpstobindthecellstogether.Theimportanceofstrongly binding these cells together is necessitated by the forces exerted by contraction.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 799 Figure 19.17 Cardiac Muscle (a) Cardiac muscle cells have myofibrils composed of myofilaments arranged in sarcomeres, T tubules to transmit the impulse from the sarcolemma to the interior of the cell, numerous mitochondria for energy, and intercalated discs that are found at the junction of different cardiac muscle cells.
(b) A photomicrograph of cardiac muscle cells shows the nuclei and intercalated discs.
(c) An intercalated disc connects cardiac muscle cells and consists of desmosomes and gap junctions.
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) Cardiac muscle undergoes aerobic respiration patterns, primarily metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates.
Myoglobin, lipids, and glycogen are all stored within the cytoplasm.
Cardiac muscle cells undergo twitch-type contractions with long refractory periods followed by brief relaxation periods.
The relaxation is essential so the heart can fill with blood for the next cycle.
The refractory period is very long to prevent the possibility of tetany, a condition in which muscle remains involuntarily contracted.
In the heart, tetany is not compatible with life, since it would prevent the heart from pumping blood.800 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Repair and Replacement Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via mitosis.
Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and at least potentially replace these dead cells.
However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the original cells, and cardiac function is reduced.
In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced by patches of scar tissue.
Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show some proliferation of original cells.
If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced.
To date, myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells seem to be nonfunctional, although those grown in Petri dishes (in vitro) do beat.
Perhaps soon this mystery will be solved, and new advances in treatment will be commonplace.
Conduction System of the Heart If embryonic heart cells are separated into a Petri dish and kept alive, each is capable of generating its own electrical impulse followed by contraction.
When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle cells are placed together, the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace, and the impulse spreads from the faster to the slower cell to trigger a contraction.Asmorecellsarejoinedtogether,thefastestcellcontinuestoassumecontroloftherate.Afullydevelopedadult heart maintains the capability of generating its own electrical impulse, triggered by the fastest cells, as part of the cardiac conductionsystem.Thecomponentsofthecardiacconductionsystemincludethesinoatrialnode,theatrioventricularnode, the atrioventricular bundle, the atrioventricular bundle branches, and the Purkinje cells ( Figure 19.18 ).
Figure 19.18 Conduction System of the Heart Specialized conducting components of the heart include the sinoatrial node, the internodal pathways, the atrioventricular node, the atrioventricular bundle, the right and left bundle branches, and the Purkinje fibers.
Sinoatrial (SA) Node Normal cardiac rhythm is established by the sinoatrial (SA) node , a specialized clump of myocardial conducting cells locatedinthesuperiorandposteriorwallsoftherightatriumincloseproximitytotheorificeofthesuperiorvenacava.The SA node has the highest inherent rate of depolarization and is known as the pacemaker of the heart.
It initiates the sinus rhythm, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart.
ThisimpulsespreadsfromitsinitiationintheSAnodethroughouttheatriathroughspecialized internodalpathways , to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the atrioventricular node.
The internodal pathways consist of three bands (anterior, middle, and posterior) that lead directly from the SA node to the next node in the conduction system, the atrioventricularnode(see Figure19.18).Theimpulsetakesapproximately50ms(milliseconds)totravelbetweenthesetwoCHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 801 nodes.
The relative importance of this pathway has been debated since the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node simply following the cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria.
In addition, there is a specialized pathway called Bachmann‚Äôs bundle or theinteratrial band that conducts the impulse directly from the rightatriumtotheleftatrium.Regardlessofthepathway,astheimpulsereachestheatrioventricularseptum,theconnective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the atrioventricular node.
Figure 19.19 illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse throughout the atria to the atrioventricular node.
Figure 19.19 Cardiac Conduction (1) The sinoatrial (SA) node and the remainder of the conduction system are at rest.
(2) The SA node initiates the action potential, which sweeps across the atria.
(3) After reaching the atrioventricular node, there is a delay of approximately 100 ms that allows the atria to complete pumping blood before the impulse is transmitted to the atrioventricular bundle.
(4) Following the delay, the impulse travels through the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches to the Purkinje fibers, and also reaches the right papillary muscle via the moderator band.
(5) The impulse spreads to the contractile fibers of the ventricle.
(6) V entricular contraction begins.
The electrical event, the wave of depolarization, is the trigger for muscular contraction.
The wave of depolarization begins in the right atrium, and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both atria and then down through the contractilecells.Thecontractilecellsthenbegincontractionfromthesuperiortotheinferiorportionsoftheatria,efficiently pumping blood into the ventricles.
Atrioventricular (AV) Node Theatrioventricular (AV) node is a second clump of specialized myocardial conductive cells, located in the inferior portion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular septum.
The septum prevents the impulse from spreading directly to the ventricles without passing through the AV node.
There is a critical pause before the AV node depolarizes and transmits the impulse to the atrioventricular bundle (see Figure 19.19, step 3).
This delay in transmission is partially attributable to the small diameter of the cells of the node, which slow the impulse.
Also, conduction between nodal cells is less efficient thanbetweenconductingcells.Thesefactorsmeanthatittakestheimpulseapproximately100mstopassthroughthenode.
Thispauseiscriticaltoheartfunction,asitallowstheatrialcardiomyocytestocompletetheircontractionthatpumpsblood into the ventricles before the impulse is transmitted to the cells of the ventricle itself.
With extreme stimulation by the SA node, the AV node can transmit impulses maximally at 220 per minute.
This establishes the typical maximum heart rate in a healthy young individual.
Damaged hearts or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates, but at these rates, the heart can no longer effectively pump blood.
Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle , orbundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches , commonly called the left and right bundle branches.
The left802 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 bundle branch has two fascicles.
The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle.
Since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the right.
Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles.
Because of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles.
This is believed to allow tensiontodeveloponthechordaetendineaepriortorightventricularcontraction.Thereisnocorrespondingmoderatorband on the left.
Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see Figure 19.19 , step 4).
This passage takes approximately 25 ms. ThePurkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cellsintheventricles.Theyextendthroughoutthemyocardiumfromtheapexofthehearttowardtheatrioventricularseptum and the base of the heart.
The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5).
Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from thebottom.Thisallowsthebloodtobepumpedoutoftheventriclesandintotheaortaandpulmonarytrunk.Thetotaltime elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA node until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms. Membrane Potentials and Ion Movement in Cardiac Conductive Cells Action potentials are considerably different between cardiac conductive cells and cardiac contractive cells.

The resulting movement of sodium ions creates spontaneous depolarization (orprepotential depolarization ).
At this point,calciumion channelsopen and Ca2+entersthecell,furtherdepolarizingitata morerapidrateuntilitreaches a value of approximately +5 mV.
At this point, the calcium ion channels close and K+channels open, allowing outflux of K+andresultinginrepolarization.Whenthemembranepotentialreachesapproximately‚àí60mV,theK+channelscloseand Na+channels open, and the prepotential phase begins again.
This phenomenon explains the autorhythmicity properties of cardiac muscle ( Figure 19.20 ).
Figure 19.20 Action Potential at the SA Node The prepotential is due to a slow influx of sodium ions until the threshold is reached followed by a rapid depolarization and repolarization.
The prepotential accounts for the membrane reaching threshold and initiates the spontaneous depolarization and contraction of the cell.
Note the lack of a resting potential.
Membrane Potentials and Ion Movement in Cardiac Contractile Cells There is a distinctly different electrical pattern involving the contractile cells.
In this case, there is a rapid depolarization, followed by a plateau phase and then repolarization.
This phenomenon accounts for the long refractory periods required for the cardiac muscle cells to pump blood effectively before they are capable of firing for a second time.
These cardiac myocytes normally do not initiate their own electrical potential, although they are capable of doing so, but rather wait for an impulse to reach them.
Contractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than conductive cells at approximately ‚àí80 mV for cells in the atria and ‚àí90 mV for cells in the ventricles.
Despite this initial difference, the other components of their action potentials are virtually identical.
In both cases, when stimulated by an action potential, voltage-gated channels rapidly open, beginning the positive-feedback mechanism of depolarization.
This rapid influx of positively charged ions raises the membrane potential to approximately +30 mV, at which point the sodium channels close.
The rapid depolarization period typically lasts 3‚Äì5 ms. Depolarization is followed by the plateau phase, in which membrane potential declines relatively slowly.
This is due in large part to the opening of the slow Ca2+channels, allowing Ca2+to enter the cell while few K+CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 803 channels are open, allowing K+to exit the cell.
The relatively long plateau phase lasts approximately 175 ms. Once the membrane potential reaches approximately zero, the Ca2+channels close and K+channels open, allowing K+to exit the cell.
The repolarization lasts approximately 75 ms. At this point, membrane potential drops until it reaches resting levels once more and the cycle repeats.
The entire event lasts between 250 and 300 ms ( Figure 19.21 ).
The absolute refractory period for cardiac contractile muscle lasts approximately 200 ms, and the relative refractory periodlastsapproximately50ms,foratotalof250ms.Thisextendedperiodiscritical,sincetheheartmusclemustcontract to pump blood effectively and the contraction must follow the electrical events.
Without extended refractory periods, premature contractions would occur in the heart and would not be compatible with life.
Figure 19.21 Action Potential in Cardiac Contractile Cells (a) Note the long plateau phase due to the influx of calcium ions.
The extended refractory period allows the cell to fully contract before another electrical event can occur.
(b) The action potential for heart muscle is compared to that of skeletal muscle.
Calcium Ions Calcium ions play two critical roles in the physiology of cardiac muscle.
Their influx through slow calcium channels accounts for the prolonged plateau phase and absolute refractory period that enable cardiac muscle to function properly.
Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin in the troponin-tropomyosin complex; this complex removes the inhibition that prevents the heads of the myosin molecules from forming cross bridges with the active sites on actin that provide the power stroke of contraction.
This mechanism is virtually identical to that of skeletal muscle.
Approximately20percentofthecalciumrequiredforcontractionissuppliedbytheinfluxofCa2+duringtheplateauphase.
The remaining Ca2+for contraction is released from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
Comparative Rates of Conduction System Firing The pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization, followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just described, are seen in the SA node and a few other conductive cells in the heart.
Since the SA node is the pacemaker, it reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system.
It will initiate the impulses spreading to the804 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 other conducting cells.
The SA node, without nervous or endocrine control, would initiate a heart impulse approximately 80‚Äì100 times per minute.
Although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse, the rate progressively slows as you proceed from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers.
Without the SA node, the AV node would generate a heart rate of 40‚Äì60 beats per minute.
If the AV node were blocked, the atrioventricular bundle would fire at a rate of approximately 30‚Äì40 impulses per minute.
The bundle branches would have an inherent rate of 20‚Äì30 impulses per minute, and the Purkinje fibers would fire at 15‚Äì20 impulses per minute.
While a few exceptionally trained aerobic athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of 30‚Äì40 beats per minute (the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per minuteforMiguelIndurain,acyclist),formostindividuals,rateslowerthan50beatsperminutewouldindicateacondition called bradycardia.
Depending upon the specific individual, as rates fall much below this level, the heart would be unable to maintain adequate flow of blood to vital tissues, initially resulting in decreasing loss of function across the systems, unconsciousness, and ultimately death.
Electrocardiogram By careful placement of surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the complex, compound electrical signal of theheart.Thistracingoftheelectricalsignalisthe electrocardiogram(ECG),alsocommonlyabbreviatedEKG(Kcoming kardiology,fromtheGermantermforcardiology).CarefulanalysisoftheECGrevealsadetailedpictureofbothnormaland abnormal heart function, and is an indispensable clinical diagnostic tool.

The greater the number of leads an electrocardiograph uses, the more informationtheECGprovides.Theterm‚Äúlead‚Äùmaybeusedtorefertothecablefromtheelectrodetotheelectricalrecorder, but it typically describes the voltage difference between two of the electrodes.
The 12-lead electrocardiograph uses 10 electrodes placed in standard locations on the patient‚Äôs skin (Figure 19.22).
In continuous ambulatory electrocardiographs, thepatientwearsasmall,portable,battery-operateddeviceknownasaHoltermonitor,orsimplyaHolter,thatcontinuously monitors heart electrical activity, typically for a period of 24 hours during the patient‚Äôs normal routine.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 805 Figure 19.22 Standard Placement of ECG Leads In a 12-lead ECG, six electrodes are placed on the chest, and four electrodes are placed on the limbs.
AnormalECGtracingispresentedin Figure19.23 .Eachcomponent,segment,andintervalislabeledandcorresponds to important electrical events, demonstrating the relationship between these events and contraction in the heart.
There are five prominent points on the ECG: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave.
The small P wave representsthedepolarizationoftheatria.Theatriabegincontractingapproximately25msafterthestartofthePwave.The largeQRScomplex representsthedepolarizationoftheventricles,whichrequiresamuchstrongerelectricalsignalbecause of the larger size of the ventricular cardiac muscle.
The ventricles begin to contract as the QRS reaches the peak of the R wave.
Lastly, the T waverepresents the repolarization of the ventricles.
The repolarization of the atria occurs during the QRS complex, which masks it on an ECG.

The PR interval starts at the beginning of the P wave and ends with the beginning of the QRS complex.
The PR interval is more clinically relevant, as it measures the duration from the beginning of atrial depolarization (the P wave) to the initiation of the QRS complex.
Since the Q wave may be difficult to view in some tracings, the measurement is often extended to the R that is more easily visible.
Should there be a delay in passage of the impulse from the SA node to the AV node, it would be visible in the PR interval.

Such an area, which may actually be a component of the conduction system or some other contractile cells, is known as an ectopic focus or ectopic pacemaker.
An ectopic focus may be stimulated by localized ischemia; exposure to certain drugs, including caffeine, digitalis, or acetylcholine; elevated stimulation by both sympathetic or parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system; or a number of disease or pathological conditions.
Occasional occurances are generally transitory and nonlife threatening, but if the condition becomes chronic, it may lead to either an arrhythmia, a deviation from the normal pattern of impulse conduction and contraction, or to fibrillation, an uncoordinated beating of the heart.
While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after some training, a full understanding of the complexities and intricacies generally requires several years of experience.
In general, the size of the electrical variations, the duration of the events, and detailed vector analysis provide the most comprehensive picture of cardiac function.
For example, an amplified P wave may indicate enlargement of the atria, an enlarged Q wave may indicate a MI, and an enlarged suppressed or inverted Q wave often indicates enlarged ventricles.
T waves often appear flatter when insufficient oxygen is being delivered to the myocardium.
An elevation of the ST segment above baseline is often seen in patients with an acute MI, and may appear depressed below the baseline when hypoxia is occurring.
As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are limitations.
For example, not all areas suffering a MI may be obvious on the ECG.
Additionally, it will not reveal the effectiveness of the pumping, which requires further testing, such as an ultrasound test called an echocardiogram or nuclear medicine imaging.
It is also possible for there to be pulseless electrical activity, which will show up on an ECG tracing, although there is no corresponding pumping action.
Common abnormalities that may be detected by the ECGs are shown in Figure 19.25 .CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 809 Figure 19.25 Common ECG Abnormalities (a) In a second-degree or partial block, one-half of the P waves are not followed by the QRS complex and T waves while the other half are.
(b) In atrial fibrillation, the electrical pattern is abnormal prior to the QRS complex, and the frequency between the QRS complexes has increased.
(c) In ventricular tachycardia, the shape of the QRS complex is abnormal.
(d) In ventricular fibrillation, there is no normal electrical activity.
(e) In a third-degree block, there is no correlation between atrial activity (the P wave) and ventricular activity (the QRS complex).

In fibrillation, the heart beats in a wild, uncontrolled manner, which prevents it from being able to pump effectively.Atrialfibrillation(see Figure19.25b)isaseriouscondition,butaslongastheventriclescontinuetopump blood, the patient‚Äôs life may not be in immediate danger.
Ventricular fibrillation (see Figure 19.25d) is a medical emergency that requires life support, because the ventricles are not effectively pumping blood.
In a hospital setting, it is often described as ‚Äúcode blue.‚Äù If untreated for as little as a few minutes, ventricular fibrillation may lead to brain death.
The most common treatment is defibrillation, which uses special paddles to apply a charge to the heart from an external electrical source in an attempt to establish a normal sinus rhythm (Figure 19.26).
A defibrillator effectively stops the heart so that the SA node can trigger a normal conduction cycle.
Because of their effectiveness inreestablishinganormalsinusrhythm,externalautomateddefibrillators(EADs)arebeingplacedinareasfrequented by large numbers of people, such as schools, restaurants, and airports.
These devices contain simple and direct verbal instructions that can be followed by nonmedical personnel in an attempt to save a life.
Figure 19.26 Defibrillators (a) An external automatic defibrillator can be used by nonmedical personnel to reestablish a normal sinus rhythm in a person with fibrillation.
(b) Defibrillator paddles are more commonly used in hospital settings.
(credit b: ‚Äúwiderider107‚Äù/flickr.com) Aheart block refers to an interruption in the normal conduction pathway.
The nomenclature for these is very straightforward.SAnodalblocksoccurwithintheSAnode.AVnodalblocksoccurwithintheAVnode.Infra-Hisianblocks involve the bundle of His.
Bundle branch blocks occur within either the left or right atrioventricular bundle branches.
Hemiblocks are partial and occur within one or more fascicles of the atrioventricular bundle branch.
Clinically, the most common types are the AV nodal and infra-Hisian blocks.
AV blocks are often described by degrees.
A first-degree or partial block indicates a delay in conduction between the SA and AV nodes.
This can be recognized on the ECG as an abnormally long PR interval.
A second-degree or incomplete block occurs when some impulses from the SA node reach the AV node and continue, while others do not.
In this instance, the ECG would reveal some P waves not followed by a QRS complex, while others would appear normal.
In the third- degree or complete block, there is no correlation between atrial activity (the P wave) and ventricular activity (the QRS complex).
Even in the event of a total SA block, the AV node will assume the role of pacemaker and continue initiating contractions at 40‚Äì60 contractions per minute, which is adequate to maintain consciousness.
Second- and third-degree blocks are demonstrated on the ECG presented in Figure 19.25 .
When arrhythmias become a chronic problem, the heart maintains a junctional rhythm, which originates in the AV node.
In order to speed up the heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant an artificial pacemaker, which delivers electrical impulses to the heart muscle to ensure that the heart continues to contract and pump blood effectively.
These artificial pacemakers are programmable by the cardiologists and can either provide stimulation temporarily upon demand or on a continuous basis.
Some devices also contain built-in defibrillators.
Cardiac Muscle Metabolism Normally, cardiac muscle metabolism is entirely aerobic.
Oxygen from the lungs is brought to the heart, and every other organ, attached to the hemoglobin molecules within the erythrocytes.
Heart cells also store appreciable amounts of oxygen in myoglobin.
Normally, these two mechanisms, circulating oxygen and oxygen attached to myoglobin, can supply sufficient oxygen to the heart, even during peak performance.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 811 Fatty acids and glucose from the circulation are broken down within the mitochondria to release energy in the form of ATP.
Both fatty acid droplets and glycogen are stored within the sarcoplasm and provide additional nutrient supply.
(Seek additional content for more detail about metabolism.)
19.3|Cardiac Cycle By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the relationship between blood pressure and blood flow ‚Ä¢Summarize the events of the cardiac cycle ‚Ä¢Compare atrial and ventricular systole and diastole ‚Ä¢Relate heart sounds detected by auscultation to action of heart‚Äô s valves The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the cardiac cycle(Figure 19.27).
The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called systole.
The period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called diastole.
Both the atria and ventricles undergosystoleanddiastole,anditisessentialthatthesecomponentsbecarefullyregulatedandcoordinatedtoensureblood is pumped efficiently to the body.
Figure 19.27 Overview of the Cardiac Cycle The cardiac cycle begins with atrial systole and progresses to ventricular systole, atrial diastole, and ventricular diastole, when the cycle begins again.
Correlations to the ECG are highlighted.
Pressures and Flow Fluids, whether gases or liquids, are materials that flow according to pressure gradients‚Äîthat is, they move from regions thatarehigherinpressuretoregionsthatarelowerinpressure.Accordingly,whentheheartchambersarerelaxed(diastole), blood will flow into the atria from the veins, which are higher in pressure.
As blood flows into the atria, the pressure will rise, so the blood will initially move passively from the atria into the ventricles.
When the action potential triggers the muscles in the atria to contract (atrial systole), the pressure within the atria rises further, pumping blood into the ventricles.812 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Duringventricularsystole,pressurerisesintheventricles,pumpingbloodintothepulmonarytrunkfromtherightventricle and into the aorta from the left ventricle.
Again, as you consider this flow and relate it to the conduction pathway, the elegance of the system should become apparent.
Phases of the Cardiac Cycle At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole).
Blood is flowing into the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus.
Blood flows into the left atrium from the four pulmonaryveins.Thetwoatrioventricularvalves,thetricuspidandmitralvalves,arebothopen,sobloodflowsunimpeded from the atria and into the ventricles.
Approximately 70‚Äì80 percent of ventricular filling occurs by this method.
The two semilunarvalves,thepulmonaryandaorticvalves,areclosed,preventingbackflowofbloodintotherightandleftventricles from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left.
Atrial Systole and Diastole Contraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG.
As the atrial muscles contract from the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular (tricuspid, and mitral or bicuspid) valves.
At the start of atrial systole, the ventricles are normally filled with approximately 70‚Äì80 percent of their capacity due to inflow during diastole.
Atrial contraction,alsoreferredtoasthe‚Äúatrialkick,‚Äùcontributestheremaining20‚Äì30percentoffilling(see Figure19.27).Atrial systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole.
Ventricular Systole Ventricular systole (see Figure 19.27) follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS complex in the ECG.
It may be conveniently divided into two phases, lasting a total of 270 ms. At the end of atrial systole and just prior to atrial contraction, the ventricles contain approximately 130 mL blood in a resting adult in a standing position.
This volume is known as the end diastolic volume (EDV) orpreload.
Initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart.
However, blood pressure quicklyrisesabovethatoftheatriathatarenowrelaxedandindiastole.Thisincreaseinpressurecausesbloodtoflowback toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves.
Since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant.
Consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction , also called isovolumetric contraction (see Figure 19.27 ).
In the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the aorta.
Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves.
Pressure generated by the leftventriclewillbeappreciablygreaterthanthepressuregeneratedbytherightventricle,sincetheexistingpressureinthe aorta will be so much higher.
Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood.
This quantity is referred to as stroke volume.
Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70‚Äì80 mL.
Since ventricular systole began with an EDV of approximately 130 mL of blood, this means that there is still 50‚Äì60 mL of blood remaining in the ventricle following contraction.
This volume of blood is known as the end systolic volume (ESV).
Ventricular Diastole Ventricular relaxation, or diastole, follows repolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the T wave of the ECG.
It too is divided into two distinct phases and lasts approximately 430 ms. Duringtheearlyphaseofventriculardiastole,astheventricularmusclerelaxes,pressureontheremainingbloodwithin theventriclebeginstofall.Whenpressurewithintheventriclesdropsbelowpressureinboththepulmonarytrunkandaorta, blood flows back toward the heart, producing the dicrotic notch (small dip) seen in blood pressure tracings.
The semilunar valves close to prevent backflow into the heart.
Since the atrioventricular valves remain closed at this point, there is no changeinthevolumeofbloodintheventricle,sotheearlyphaseofventriculardiastoleiscalledthe isovolumicventricular relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase (see Figure 19.27 ).
In the second phase of ventricular diastole, called late ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the blood within the ventricles drops even further.
Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria.
When this occurs, blood flows from the atria into the ventricles, pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves.
As pressure drops within the ventricles, blood flows from the major veins into the relaxed atria and from there into the ventricles.
Both chambers are in diastole,theatrioventricularvalvesareopen, and thesemilunarvalvesremainclosed(see Figure 19.27).
Thecardiaccycle is complete.
Figure 19.28 illustrates the relationship between the cardiac cycle and the ECG.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 813 Figure 19.28 Relationship between the Cardiac Cycle and ECG Initially, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole).
The P wave represents depolarization of the atria and is followed by atrial contraction (systole).
Atrial systole extends until the QRS complex, at which point, the atria relax.
The QRS complex represents depolarization of the ventricles and is followed by ventricular contraction.
The T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles and marks the beginning of ventricular relaxation.
Heart Sounds One of the simplest, yet effective, diagnostic techniques applied to assess the state of a patient‚Äôs heart is auscultation using a stethoscope.
In a normal, healthy heart, there are only two audible heart sounds: S 1and S2.
S1is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as a ‚Äúlub,‚Äù or first heart sound.
The second heart sound, S 2, is the sound of the closing of the semilunar valves during ventricular diastole and is described as a ‚Äúdub‚Äù (Figure 19.29 ).
In both cases, as the valves close, the openings within the atrioventricular septum guarded by the valves will become reduced, and blood flow through the opening will become more turbulent until the valves are fully closed.
There is a third heart sound, S 3, but it is rarely heard in healthy individuals.
It may be the sound of blood flowing into the atria, or blood sloshing back and forth in the ventricle, or even tensing of the chordae tendineae.
S 3may be heard in youth, some athletes, and pregnant women.
If the sound is heard later in life, it may indicate congestive heart failure, warranting further tests.
Some cardiologists refer to the collective S 1, S2, and S3sounds as the ‚ÄúKentucky gallop,‚Äù because theymimicthoseproducedbyagallopinghorse.Thefourthheartsound,S 4,resultsfromthecontractionoftheatriapushing blood into a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle, indicating failure of the left ventricle.
S 4occurs prior to S 1and the collective sounds S 4, S1, and S2are referred to by some cardiologists as the ‚ÄúTennessee gallop,‚Äù because of their similarity to the sound produced by a galloping horse with a different gait.
A few individuals may have both S 3and S4, and this combined sound is referred to as S 7.814 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 19.29 Heart Sounds and the Cardiac Cycle In this illustration, the x-axis reflects time with a recording of the heart sounds.
The y-axis represents pressure.
The term murmur is used to describe an unusual sound coming from the heart that is caused by the turbulent flow of blood.
Murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the most common, the most difficult sound to detect, and the least serious.
The most severe is a 6.
Phonocardiograms or auscultograms can be used to record both normal and abnormal sounds using specialized electronic stethoscopes.
During auscultation, it is common practice for the clinician to ask the patient to breathe deeply.
This procedure not only allows for listening to airflow, but it may also amplify heart murmurs.
Inhalation increases blood flow into the right side of the heart and may increase the amplitude of right-sided heart murmurs.
Expiration partially restricts blood flow into the left side of the heart and may amplify left-sided heart murmurs.
Figure 19.30 indicates proper placement of the bell of the stethoscope to facilitate auscultation.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 815 Figure 19.30 Stethoscope Placement for Auscultation Proper placement of the bell of the stethoscope facilitates auscultation.
At each of the four locations on the chest, a different valve can be heard.
19.4|Cardiac Physiology By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Relate heart rate to cardiac output ‚Ä¢Describe the effect of exercise on heart rate ‚Ä¢Identify cardiovascular centers and cardiac reflexes that regulate heart function ‚Ä¢Describe factors affecting heart rate ‚Ä¢Distinguish between positive and negative factors that affect heart contractility ‚Ä¢Summarize factors affecting stroke volume and cardiac output ‚Ä¢Describe the cardiac response to variations in blood flow and pressure The autorhythmicity inherent in cardiac cells keeps the heart beating at a regular pace; however, the heart is regulated by and responds to outside influences as well.
Neural and endocrine controls are vital to the regulation of cardiac function.
In addition, the heart is sensitive to several environmental factors, including electrolytes.
Resting Cardiac Output Cardiac output (CO) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute.
To calculate this value, multiply stroke volume (SV), the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle, by heart rate (HR), in contractions per minute (or beats per minute, bpm).
It can be represented mathematically by the following equation: CO = HR √ó SV SVisnormallymeasuredusinganechocardiogramtorecordEDVandESV,andcalculatingthedifference:SV=EDV ‚Äì ESV.
SV can also be measured using a specialized catheter, but this is an invasive procedure and far more dangerous to the patient.
A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL.
There are several important variables, including size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload or resistance.
Normal range for SV would be 55‚Äì100 mL.
An average resting HR would be approximately 75 bpm but could range from 60‚Äì100 in some individuals.816 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Using these numbers, the mean CO is 5.25 L/min, with a range of 4.0‚Äì8.0 L/min.
Remember, however, that these numbers refer to CO from each ventricle separately, not the total for the heart.
Factors influencing CO are summarized in Figure 19.31 .
Figure 19.31 Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output Cardiac output is influenced by heart rate and stroke volume, both of which are also variable.
SVs are also used to calculate ejection fraction , which is the portion of the blood that is pumped or ejected from the heart with each contraction.
To calculate ejection fraction, SV is divided by EDV.
Despite the name, the ejection fraction is normallyexpressedasapercentage.Ejectionfractionsrangefromapproximately55‚Äì70percent,withameanof58percent.
Exercise and Maximum Cardiac Output Inhealthyyoungindividuals,HRmayincreaseto150bpmduringexercise.SVcanalsoincreasefrom70toapproximately 130mLduetoincreasedstrengthofcontraction.ThiswouldincreaseCOtoapproximately19.5L/min,4‚Äì5timestheresting rate.
Top cardiovascular athletes can achieve even higher levels.
At their peak performance, they may increase resting CO by 7‚Äì8 times.
Since the heart is a muscle, exercising it increases its efficiency.
The difference between maximum and resting CO is known as the cardiac reserve.
It measures the residual capacity of the heart to pump blood.
Heart Rates HRsvaryconsiderably,notonlywithexerciseandfitnesslevels,butalsowithage.NewbornrestingHRsmaybe120bpm.
HR gradually decreases until young adulthood and then gradually increases again with age.
Maximum HRs are normally in the range of 200‚Äì220 bpm, although there are some extreme cases in which they may reach higher levels.
As one ages, the ability to generate maximum rates decreases.
This may be estimated by taking the maximal value of 220 bpm and subtracting the individual‚Äôs age.
So a 40-year-old individual would be expected to hit a maximum rate of approximately 180, and a 60-year-old person would achieve a HR of 160.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 817 Heart: Abnormal Heart Rates For an adult, normal resting HR will be in the range of 60‚Äì100 bpm.
Bradycardia is the condition in which resting ratedropsbelow60bpm,andtachycardiaistheconditioninwhichtherestingrateisabove100bpm.Trainedathletes typically have very low HRs.
If the patient is not exhibiting other symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, dizziness, fainting, chest discomfort, palpitations, or respiratory distress, bradycardia is not considered clinically significant.
However,ifanyofthesesymptomsarepresent,theymayindicatethattheheartisnotprovidingsufficientoxygenated bloodtothetissues.ThetermrelativebradycardiamaybeusedwithapatientwhohasaHRinthenormalrangebutis still suffering from these symptoms.
Most patients remain asymptomatic as long as the HR remains above 50 bpm.
Bradycardia may be caused by either inherent factors or causes external to the heart.
While the condition may be inherited, typically it is acquired in older individuals.
Inherent causes include abnormalities in either the SA or AV node.
If the condition is serious, a pacemaker may be required.
Other causes include ischemia to the heart muscle or diseases of the heart vessels or valves.
External causes include metabolic disorders, pathologies of the endocrine system often involving the thyroid, electrolyte imbalances, neurological disorders including inappropriate autonomic responses, autoimmune pathologies, over-prescription of beta blocker drugs that reduce HR, recreational drug use, or even prolonged bed rest.
Treatment relies upon establishing the underlying cause of the disorder and may necessitate supplemental oxygen.
Tachycardiaisnotnormalinarestingpatientbutmaybedetectedinpregnantwomenorindividualsexperiencing extreme stress.
In the latter case, it would likely be triggered by stimulation from the limbic system or disorders of the autonomic nervous system.
In some cases, tachycardia may involve only the atria.
Some individuals may remain asymptomatic, but when present, symptoms may include dizziness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, rapid pulse, heart palpations, chest pain, or fainting (syncope).
While tachycardia is defined as a HR above 100 bpm, there is considerable variation among people.
Further, the normal resting HRs of children are often above 100 bpm, but this is not considered to be tachycardia Many causes of tachycardia may be benign, but the condition may also be correlated with fever, anemia, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, hypersecretion of catecholamines, some cardiomyopathies, some disorders of the valves, and acute exposure to radiation.
Elevated rates in an exercising or resting patient are normal and expected.
Resting rate should always be taken after recovery from exercise.
Treatment depends upon the underlying cause but may include medications, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ablation, or sur gery.
Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output Initially,physiologicalconditionsthatcauseHRtoincreasealsotriggeranincreaseinSV.Duringexercise,therateofblood returning to the heart increases.
However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time for the ventricles to fill with blood.
Even though there is less filling time, SV will initially remain high.
However, as HR continues to increase, SV gradually decreases due to decreased filling time.
CO will initially stabilize as the increasing HR compensatesforthedecreasingSV,butatveryhighrates,COwilleventuallydecreaseasincreasingratesarenolongerable to compensate for the decreasing SV.
Consider this phenomenon in a healthy young individual.
Initially, as HR increases from resting to approximately 120 bpm, CO will rise.
As HR increases from 120 to 160 bpm, CO remains stable, since the increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular filling time and, consequently, SV.
As HR continues to rise above 160 bpm, CO actually decreases as SV falls faster than HR increases.
So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the health of the heart, individuals are cautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of between 120 and 160 bpm, so CO is maintained.
The target HR is loosely defined as the range in which both the heart and lungs receive the maximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age.
Cardiovascular Centers Nervous control over HR is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centers of the medulla oblongata ( Figure 19.32).
The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve, cranial nerve X.
During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone.
This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles.
Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.
Both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulations flow through a paired complex network of nerve fibers known as thecardiac plexus near the base of the heart.
The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1‚ÄìT4) to both the SA and AV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles.
The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers.
Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) at the neuromuscularjunctionofthecardiacnerves.NEshortenstherepolarizationperiod,thusspeedingtherateofdepolarization818 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 and contraction, which results in an increase in HR.
It opens chemical- or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions.
NE binds to the beta-1 receptor.
Some cardiac medications (for example, beta blockers) work by blocking these receptors,therebyslowingHRandareonepossibletreatmentforhypertension.Overprescriptionofthesedrugsmayleadto bradycardia and even stoppage of the heart.
Figure 19.32 Autonomic Innervation of the Heart Cardioaccelerator and cardioinhibitory areas are components of the paired cardiac centers located in the medulla oblongata of the brain.
They innervate the heart via sympathetic cardiac nerves that increase cardiac activity and vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that slow cardiac activity .
Parasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).
The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles.
Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction.
AChslowsHRbyopeningchemical-orligand-gatedpotassiumionchannelstoslowtherateofspontaneousdepolarization, whichextendsrepolarizationandincreasesthetimebeforethenextspontaneousdepolarizationoccurs.Withoutanynervous stimulation,theSAnodewouldestablishasinusrhythmofapproximately100bpm.Sincerestingratesareconsiderablyless than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR.
This is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal.
To speed up, one need merely remove one‚Äôs foot from the break and let the engine increasespeed.Inthecaseoftheheart,decreasingparasympatheticstimulationdecreasesthereleaseofACh,whichallows HRtoincreaseuptoapproximately100bpm.Anyincreasesbeyondthisratewouldrequiresympatheticstimulation.
Figure 19.33illustrates the effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation on the normal sinus rhythm.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 819 Figure 19.33 Effects of Parasympathetic and Sympathetic Stimulation on Normal Sinus Rhythm The wave of depolarization in a normal sinus rhythm shows a stable resting HR.
Following parasympathetic stimulation, HR slows.
Following sympathetic stimulation, HR increases.
Input to the Cardiovascular Center Thecardiovascularcenterreceivesinputfromaseriesofvisceralreceptorswithimpulsestravelingthroughvisceralsensory fibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus.
Among these receptors are various proprioreceptors, baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system.
Collectively, these inputs normally enable the cardiovascularcenterstoregulateheartfunctionprecisely,aprocessknownas cardiacreflexes .Increasedphysicalactivity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons.
Any such increaseinphysicalactivitywouldlogicallywarrantincreasedbloodflow.Thecardiaccentersmonitortheseincreasedrates of firing, and suppress parasympathetic stimulation and increase sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase blood flow.
Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself.
Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood.
The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex .
With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation.
As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.
There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex orBainbridge reflex , associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria.
Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located.
However, as theatrialbaroreceptorsincreasetheirrateoffiringandastheystretchduetotheincreasedbloodpressure,thecardiaccenter responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase HR.
The opposite is also true.820 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Increased metabolic byproducts associated with increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and lactic acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.
These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers about the need for increased or decreased blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.
ThelimbicsystemcanalsosignificantlyimpactHRrelatedtoemotionalstate.Duringperiodsofstress,itisnotunusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol.
Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks.
These events are typically transient and treatable.
Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively.Doingsimpledeepandslowbreathingexerciseswithone‚Äôseyesclosedcanalsosignificantlyreducethisanxiety and HR.
Heart: Broken Heart Syndrome Extremestress from such life events as the death of a loved one, an emotionalbreak up, loss of income,or foreclosure of a home may lead to a condition commonly referred to as broken heart syndrome.
This condition may also be called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, transient apical ballooning syndrome, apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy,Gebrochenes-Herzsyndrome,andstresscardiomyopathy.Therecognizedeffectsontheheartinclude congestive heart failure due to a profound weakening of the myocardium not related to lack of oxygen.
This may lead toacuteheartfailure,lethalarrhythmias,oreventheruptureofaventricle.Theexactetiologyisnotknown,butseveral factorshavebeensuggested,includingtransientvasospasm,dysfunctionofthecardiaccapillaries,orthickeningofthe myocardium‚Äîparticularly in the left ventricle‚Äîthat may lead to the critical circulation of blood to this region.
While manypatientssurvivetheinitialacuteeventwithtreatmenttorestorenormalfunction,thereisastrongcorrelationwith death.
Careful statistical analysis by the Cass Business School, a prestigious institution located in London, published in 2008, revealed that within one year of the death of a loved one, women are more than twice as likely to die and males are six times as likely to die as would otherwise be expected.
Other Factors Influencing Heart Rate Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise control over HR.
However, there are a number of other factors that have an impact on HR as well, including epinephrine, NE, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia; and pH balance (Table 19.1 andTable 19.2).
After reading this section, the importance of maintaining homeostasis should become even more apparent.
Major Factors Increasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction Factor Effect Cardioaccelerator nerves Release of norepinephrine Proprioreceptors Increased rates of firing during exercise Chemoreceptors Decreased levels of O 2; increased levels of H+, CO 2, and lactic acid Baroreceptors Decreased rates of firing, indicating falling blood volume/pressure Limbic system Anticipation of physical exercise or strong emotions Catecholamines Increased epinephrine and norepinephrine Thyroid hormones Increased T 3and T 4 Calcium Increased Ca2+ Potassium Decreased K+ Sodium Decreased Na+ Body temperature Increased body temperature Table 19.1CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 821 Major Factors Increasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction Factor Effect Nicotine and caffeine Stimulants, increasing heart rate Table 19.1 Factors Decreasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction Factor Effect Cardioinhibitor nerves (vagus) Release of acetylcholine Proprioreceptors Decreased rates of firing following exercise Chemoreceptors Increased levels of O 2; decreased levels of H+and CO 2 Baroreceptors Increased rates of firing, indicating higher blood volume/pressure Limbic system Anticipation of relaxation Catecholamines Decreased epinephrine and norepinephrine Thyroid hormones Decreased T 3and T 4 Calcium Decreased Ca2+ Potassium Increased K+ Sodium Increased Na+ Body temperature Decrease in body temperature Table 19.2 Epinephrine and Norepinephrine The catecholamines, epinephrine and NE, secreted by the adrenal medulla form one component of the extended fight-or- flight mechanism.
The other component is sympathetic stimulation.
Epinephrine and NE have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels.
The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened.
However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias.
There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.
Thyroid Hormones In general, increased levels of thyroid hormone, or thyroxin, increase cardiac rate and contractility.
The impact of thyroid hormone is typically of a much longer duration than that of the catecholamines.
The physiologically active form of thyroid hormone, T 3or triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity at the level of the genome.
It also impacts the beta adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and NE described above.
Excessive levels of thyroxin may trigger tachycardia.
Calcium Calcium ion levels have great impacts upon both HR and contractility; as the levels of calcium ions increase, so do HR and contractility.
High levels of calcium ions (hypercalcemia) may be implicated in a short QT interval and a widened T wave in the ECG.
The QT interval represents the time from the start of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles, and includes the period of ventricularsystole.
Extremelyhigh levels of calciummay induce cardiacarrest.
Drugs known as calcium channel blockers slow HR by binding to these channels and blocking or slowing the inward movement of calcium ions.
Caffeine and Nicotine Caffeine and nicotine are not found naturally within the body.
Both of these nonregulated drugs have an excitatory effect onmembranesofneuronsingeneralandhaveastimulatoryeffectonthecardiaccentersspecifically,causinganincreasein HR.
Caffeineworks by increasingtheratesof depolarizationattheSA node,whereasnicotinestimulatestheactivityof the sympathetic neurons that deliver impulses to the heart.822 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Althoughitistheworld‚Äôsmostwidelyconsumedpsychoactivedrug,caffeineislegalandnotregulated.Whileprecise quantitieshavenotbeenestablished,‚Äúnormal‚Äùconsumptionisnotconsideredharmfultomostpeople,althoughitmaycause disruptions to sleep and acts as a diuretic.
Its consumption by pregnant women is cautioned against, although no evidence of negative effects has been confirmed.
Tolerance and even physical and mental addiction to the drug result in individuals who routinely consume the substance.
Nicotine, too, is a stimulant and produces addiction.
While legal and nonregulated, concerns about nicotine‚Äôs safety and documented links to respiratory and cardiac disease have resulted in warning labels on cigarette packages.
Factors Decreasing Heart Rate HR can be slowed when a person experiences altered sodium and potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia(see Table19.1).TherelationshipbetweenelectrolytesandHRiscomplex,butmaintainingelectrolytebalance is critical to the normal wave of depolarization.
Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance.
Initially, both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia.
Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease.
Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias.
Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.
Heartmusclereliesexclusivelyonaerobicmetabolismforenergy.Hypoxia(aninsufficientsupplyofoxygen)leadsto decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.
Acidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient‚Äôs blood expresses a low pH value.
Alkalosisisaconditioninwhichtherearetoofewhydrogenions,andthepatient‚ÄôsbloodhasanelevatedpH.Normalblood pH falls in the range of 7.35‚Äì7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents alkalosis.
Recall that enzymes are the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions; they are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range.
These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR.
Severe changes in pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.
The last variable is body temperature.
Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body temperature is called hypothermia.
Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction.
Hypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions.
This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged.
If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery.
In this case, the patient‚Äôs blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart- lung machine to maintain the body‚Äôs blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored.
Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.
Stroke Volume Many of the same factors that regulate HR also impact cardiac function by altering SV.
While a number of variables are involved,SVisultimatelydependentuponthedifferencebetweenEDVandESV.Thethreeprimaryfactorstoconsiderare preload,orthestretchontheventriclespriortocontraction;thecontractility,ortheforceorstrengthofthecontractionitself; and afterload, the force the ventricles must generate to pump blood against the resistance in the vessels.
These factors are summarized in Table 19.1 andTable 19.2.
Preload PreloadisanotherwayofexpressingEDV.Therefore,thegreatertheEDVis,thegreaterthepreloadis.Oneoftheprimary factors to consider is filling time, or the duration of ventricular diastole during which filling occurs.
The more rapidly the heart contracts, the shorter the filling time becomes, and the lower the EDV and preload are.
This effect can be partially overcome by increasing the second variable, contractility, and raising SV, but over time, the heart is unable to compensate for decreased filling time, and preload also decreases.
Withincreasingventricularfilling,bothEDVorpreloadincrease,andthecardiacmuscleitselfisstretchedtoagreater degree.
At rest, there is little stretch of the ventricular muscle, and the sarcomeres remain short.
With increased ventricular filling, the ventricular muscle is increasingly stretched and the sarcomere length increases.
As the sarcomeres reach their optimal lengths, they will contract more powerfully, because more of the myosin heads can bind to the actin on the thin filaments, forming cross bridges and increasing the strength of contraction and SV.
If this process were to continue and the sarcomeres stretched beyond their optimal lengths, the force of contraction would decrease.
However, due to the physical constraints of the location of the heart, this excessive stretch is not a concern.
The relationship between ventricular stretch and contraction has been stated in the well-known Frank-Starling mechanism or simply Starling‚Äôs Law of the Heart.
This principle states that, within physiological limits, the force of heart contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber.
This means that the greater the stretch of the ventricularmuscle(withinlimits),themorepowerfulthecontractionis,whichinturnincreasesSV.Therefore,byincreasing preload, you increase the second variable, contractility.
Otto Frank (1865‚Äì1944) was a German physiologist; among his many published works are detailed studies of this importantheartrelationship.ErnestStarling(1866‚Äì1927)wasanimportantEnglishphysiologistwhoalsostudiedtheheart.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 823 Although they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the name ‚ÄúFrank-Starling mechanism.‚Äù Any sympathetic stimulation to the venous system will increase venous return to the heart, which contributes to ventricular filling, and EDV and preload.
While much of the ventricular filling occurs while both atria and ventricles are in diastole, the contraction of the atria, the atrial kick, plays a crucial role by providing the last 20‚Äì30 percent of ventricular filling.
Contractility It is virtually impossible to consider preload or ESV without including an early mention of the concept of contractility.
Indeed, the two parameters are intimately linked.
Contractility refers to the force of the contraction of the heart muscle, whichcontrolsSV,andistheprimaryparameterforimpactingESV.Themoreforcefulthecontractionis,thegreatertheSV andsmallertheESVare.LessforcefulcontractionsresultinsmallerSVsandlargerESVs.Factorsthatincreasecontractility aredescribedas positiveinotropicfactors ,andthosethatdecreasecontractilityaredescribedas negativeinotropicfactors (ino- = ‚Äúfiber;‚Äù -tropic = ‚Äúturning toward‚Äù).
Not surprisingly, sympathetic stimulation is a positive inotrope, whereas parasympathetic stimulation is a negative inotrope.
Sympathetic stimulation triggers the release of NE at the neuromuscular junction from the cardiac nerves and also stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete epinephrine and NE.
In addition to their stimulatory effects on HR, they also bind to both alpha and beta receptors on the cardiac muscle cell membrane to increase metabolic rate and the force of contraction.
This combination of actions has the net effect of increasing SV and leaving a smaller residual ESV in the ventricles.
In comparison, parasympathetic stimulation releases ACh at the neuromuscular junction from the vagus nerve.
The membrane hyperpolarizes and inhibits contraction to decrease the strength of contraction and SV, and to raise ESV.
Sinceparasympatheticfibersaremorewidespreadintheatriathanintheventricles,theprimarysiteofactionisintheupper chambers.
Parasympathetic stimulation in the atria decreases the atrial kick and reduces EDV, which decreases ventricular stretch and preload, thereby further limiting the force of ventricular contraction.
Stronger parasympathetic stimulation also directly decreases the force of contraction of the ventricles.
Several synthetic drugs, including dopamine and isoproterenol, have been developed that mimic the effects of epinephrine and NE by stimulating the influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid.
Higher concentrations of intracellular calcium ions increase the strength of contraction.
Excess calcium (hypercalcemia) also acts as a positive inotropic agent.
The drug digitalis lowers HR and increases the strength of the contraction, acting as a positive inotropic agent by blocking the sequestering of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
This leads to higher intracellular calcium levels and greater strength of contraction.
In addition to the catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, other hormones also demonstrate positive inotropic effects.
These include thyroid hormones and glucagon from the pancreas.
Negative inotropic agents include hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and a variety of synthetic drugs.
These include numerous beta blockers and calcium channel blockers.
Early beta blocker drugs include propranolol and pronethalol, and are credited with revolutionizing treatment of cardiac patients experiencing angina pectoris.
There is also a large class of dihydropyridine,phenylalkylamine,andbenzothiazepinecalciumchannelblockersthatmaybeadministereddecreasingthe strength of contraction and SV.
Afterload Afterload refers to the tension that the ventricles must develop to pump blood effectively against the resistance in the vascular system.
Any condition that increases resistance requires a greater afterload to force open the semilunar valves and pumptheblood.Damagetothevalves,suchasstenosis,whichmakesthemhardertoopenwillalsoincreaseafterload.Any decrease in resistance decreases the afterload.

It begins beating and pumping blood around day 21 or 22, a mere three weeks after fertilization.
This emphasizes the critical nature of the heart in distributing blood through the vessels and thevitalexchangeofnutrients,oxygen,andwastesbothtoandfromthedevelopingbaby.Thecriticalearlydevelopmentof the heart is reflected by the prominent heart bulge that appears on the anterior surface of the embryo.
The heart forms from an embryonic tissue called mesoderm around 18 to 19 days after fertilization.
Mesoderm is one ofthethreeprimarygermlayersthatdifferentiatesearlyindevelopmentthatcollectivelygivesrisetoallsubsequenttissues andorgans.Theheartbeginstodevelopneartheheadoftheembryoinaregionknownasthe cardiogenicarea.Following chemical signals called factors from the underlying endoderm (another of the three primary germ layers), the cardiogenic area begins to form two strands called the cardiogenic cords (Figure 19.36 ).
As the cardiogenic cords develop, a lumen rapidly develops within them.
At this point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes.
The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube.
The primitive heart tube quickly forms five distinct regions.
From head to tail, these include the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus.
Initially, all826 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 venousbloodflowsintothesinusvenosus,andcontractionspropelthebloodfromtailtohead,orfromthesinusvenosusto the truncus arteriosus.

Partitioning of the atria and ventricles by the interatrial septum, interventricular septum, and atrioventricular septum is complete by the end of the fifth week, although the fetal blood shunts remain until birth or shortly after.

The action potential for the conductive cells consists of a prepotential phase with a slow influx of Na+ followed by a rapid influx of Ca2+and outflux of K+.
Contractile cells have an action potential with an extended plateau phase that results in an extended refractory period to allow complete contraction for the heart to pump blood effectively.
Recognizable points on the ECG include the P wave that corresponds to atrial depolarization, the QRS complex that corresponds to ventricular depolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to ventricular repolarization.
19.3 Cardiac Cycle The cardiac cycle comprises a complete relaxation and contraction of both the atria and ventricles, and lasts approximately 0.8 seconds.
Beginning with all chambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the veins into the atria and past the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles.
The atria begin to contract (atrial systole), following depolarization of the atria, and pump blood into the ventricles.
The ventricles begin to contract (ventricular systole), raising pressure within the ventricles.
When ventricular pressure rises above the pressure in the atria, blood flows toward the atria, producing the first heart sound, S 1or lub.
As pressure in the ventricles rises above two major arteries, blood pushes open the two semilunar valvesandmovesintothepulmonarytrunkandaortaintheventricularejectionphase.Followingventricularrepolarization, the ventricles begin to relax (ventricular diastole), and pressure within the ventricles drops.
As ventricular pressure drops, thereisatendencyforbloodtoflowbackintotheatriafromthemajorarteries,producingthedicroticnotchintheECGand closing the two semilunar valves.
The second heart sound, S 2or dub, occurs when the semilunar valves close.
When the pressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from the atria into the ventricles, opening the atrioventricular valves and markingonecompleteheartcycle.Thevalvespreventbackflowofblood.Failureofthevalvestooperateproperlyproduces turbulent blood flow within the heart; the resulting heart murmur can often be heard with a stethoscope.
19.4 Cardiac Physiology Many factors affect HR and SV, and together, they contribute to cardiac function.
HR is largely determined and regulated by autonomic stimulation and hormones.
There are several feedback loops that contribute to maintaining homeostasis dependent upon activity levels, such as the atrial reflex, which is determined by venous return.CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 833 SV is regulated by autonomic innervation and hormones, but also by filling time and venous return.
Venous return is determined by activity of the skeletal muscles, blood volume, and changes in peripheral circulation.
Venous return determines preload and the atrial reflex.
Filling time directly related to HR also determines preload.
Preload then impacts bothEDVandESV.Autonomicinnervationandhormoneslargelyregulatecontractility.ContractilityimpactsEDVasdoes afterload.
CO is the product of HR multiplied by SV.
SV is the difference between EDV and ESV.

When vessel functioning is reduced, blood-borne substances do not circulate effectively throughout the body.
As a result, tissue injury occurs, metabolism is impaired, and the functions of every bodily system are threatened.
20.1|Structure and Function of Blood Vessels By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Compare and contrast the three tunics that make up the walls of most blood vessels ‚Ä¢Distinguishbetweenelasticarteries,musculararteries,andarteriolesonthebasisofstructure,location,andfunction ‚Ä¢Describe the basic structure of a capillary bed, from the supplying metarteriole to the venule into which it drains ‚Ä¢Explain the structure and function of venous valves in the large veins of the extremities Blood is carried through the body via blood vessels.
An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart, where it branches into ever-smaller vessels.
Eventually, the smallest arteries, vessels called arterioles, further branch into tinycapillaries,wherenutrientsandwastesareexchanged,andthencombinewithothervesselsthatexitcapillariestoform venules, small blood vessels that carry blood to a vein, a larger blood vessel that returns blood to the heart.

Systemic arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the body‚Äôs tissues.
The blood returned to the heart through systemic veins has less oxygen, since much of the oxygen carried by the arteries has been delivered to the cells.

The systemic circuit moves blood from the left side of the heart to the head and body and returns it to the right side of the heart to repeat the cycle.
The arrows indicate the direction of blood flow, and the colors show the relative levels of oxygen concentration.
Shared Structures Different types of blood vessels vary slightly in their structures, but they share the same general features.
Arteries and arterioles have thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the heart and receive blood that is surging at a far greater pressure (Figure 20.3).
Each type of vessel has a lumen‚Äîa hollow passageway through which blood flows.
Arteries have smaller lumens than veins, a characteristic that helps to maintain the pressure of blood moving through the system.Together,theirthickerwallsandsmallerdiametersgivearteriallumensamoreroundedappearanceincrosssection than the lumens of veins.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 839 Figure 20.3 Structure of Blood Vessels (a) Arteries and (b) veins share the same general features, but the walls of arteries are much thicker because of the higher pressure of the blood that flows through them.
(c) A micrograph shows the relative differences in thickness.
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) By the time blood has passed through capillaries and entered venules, the pressure initially exerted upon it by heart contractions has diminished.
In other words, in comparison to arteries, venules and veins withstand a much lower pressure from the blood that flows through them.
Their walls are considerably thinner and their lumens are correspondingly larger in diameter, allowing more blood to flow with less vessel resistance.
In addition, many veins of the body, particularly those of the limbs, contain valves that assist the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart.
This is critical because blood flow becomes sluggish in the extremities, as a result of the lower pressure and the ef fects of gravity.
The walls of arteries and veins are largely composed of living cells and their products (including collagenous and elastic fibers); the cells require nourishment and produce waste.
Since blood passes through the larger vessels relatively quickly,thereislimitedopportunityforbloodinthelumenofthevesseltoprovidenourishmenttoorremovewastefromthe vessel‚Äôs cells.
Further, the walls of the larger vessels are too thick for nutrients to diffuse through to all of the cells.
Larger arteries and veins contain small blood vessels within their walls known as the vasa vasorum‚Äîliterally ‚Äúvessels of the vessel‚Äù‚Äîto provide them with this critical exchange.
Since the pressure within arteries is relatively high, the vasa vasorum must function in the outer layers of the vessel (see Figure 20.3) or the pressure exerted by the blood passing through the vesselwouldcollapseit,preventinganyexchangefromoccurring.Thelowerpressurewithinveinsallowsthevasavasorum to be located closer to the lumen.
The restriction of the vasa vasorum to the outer layers of arteries is thought to be one reasonthatarterialdiseasesaremorecommonthanvenousdiseases,sinceitslocationmakesitmoredifficulttonourishthe cells of the arteries and remove waste products.
There are also minute nerves within the walls of both types of vessels that control the contraction and dilation of smooth muscle.
These minute nerves are known as the nervi vasorum.840 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Both arteries and veins have the same three distinct tissue layers, called tunics (from the Latin term tunica), for the garments first worn by ancient Romans; the term tunic is also used for some modern garments.
From the most interior layer to the outer, these tunics are the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the tunica externa (see Figure 20.3).
Table 20.1 compares and contrasts the tunics of the arteries and veins.
Comparison of Tunics in Arteries and Veins Arteries Veins General appearanceThick walls with small lumens Generally appear roundedThin walls with large lumens Generally appear flattened Tunica intimaEndothelium usually appears wavy due to constriction of smooth muscle Internal elastic membrane present in larger vesselsEndothelium appears smooth Internal elastic membrane absent Tunica mediaNormally the thickest layer in arteries Smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers predominate (the proportions of these vary with distance from the heart) External elastic membrane present in larger vesselsNormally thinner than the tunica externa Smooth muscle cells and collagenous fibers predominate Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum present External elastic membrane absent Tunica externaNormally thinner than the tunica media in all but the largest arteries Collagenous and elastic fibers Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum presentNormally the thickest layer in veins Collagenous and smooth fibers predominate Some smooth muscle fibers Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum present Table 20.1 Tunica Intima Thetunica intima (also called the tunica interna) is composed of epithelial and connective tissue layers.
Lining the tunica intima is the specialized simple squamous epithelium called the endothelium, which is continuous throughout the entire vascular system, including the lining of the chambers of the heart.
Damage to this endothelial lining and exposure of blood tothecollagenousfibersbeneathisoneoftheprimarycausesofclotformation.Untilrecently,theendotheliumwasviewed simply as the boundary between the blood in the lumen and the walls of the vessels.
Recent studies, however, have shown that it is physiologically critical to such activities as helping to regulate capillary exchange and altering blood flow.
The endothelium releases local chemicals called endothelins that can constrict the smooth muscle within the walls of the vessel to increase blood pressure.
Uncompensated overproduction of endothelins may contribute to hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiovascular disease.
Next to the endothelium is the basement membrane, or basal lamina, that effectively binds the endothelium to the connective tissue.
The basement membrane provides strength while maintaining flexibility, and it is permeable, allowing materials to pass through it.
The thin outer layer of the tunica intima contains a small amount of areolar connective tissue that consists primarily of elastic fibers to provide the vessel with additional flexibility; it also contains some collagenous fibers to provide additional strength.
In larger arteries, there is also a thick, distinct layer of elastic fibers known as the internal elastic membrane (also calledtheinternalelasticlamina)attheboundarywiththetunicamedia.Liketheothercomponentsofthetunicaintima,the internal elastic membrane provides structure while allowing the vessel to stretch.
It is permeated with small openings that allow exchange of materials between the tunics.
The internal elastic membrane is not apparent in veins.
In addition, many veins, particularly in the lower limbs, contain valves formed by sections of thickened endothelium that are reinforced with connective tissue, extending into the lumen.
Under the microscope, the lumen and the entire tunica intima of a vein will appear smooth, whereas those of an artery will normally appear wavy because of the partial constriction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media, the next layer of blood vessel walls.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 841 Tunica Media Thetunica media is the substantial middle layer of the vessel wall (see Figure 20.3).
It is generally the thickest layer in arteries,anditismuchthickerinarteriesthanitisinveins.Thetunicamediaconsistsoflayersofsmoothmusclesupported by connective tissue that is primarily made up of elastic fibers, most of which are arranged in circular sheets.
Toward the outer portion of the tunic, there are also layers of longitudinal muscle.
Contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles decrease and increase the diameter of the vessel lumen, respectively.
Specifically in arteries, vasoconstriction decreases bloodflowasthesmoothmuscleinthewallsofthetunicamediacontracts,makingthelumennarrowerandincreasingblood pressure.Similarly, vasodilation increasesbloodflowasthesmoothmusclerelaxes,allowingthelumentowidenandblood pressure to drop.
Both vasoconstriction and vasodilation are regulated in part by small vascular nerves, known as nervi vasorum, or ‚Äúnerves of the vessel,‚Äù that run within the walls of blood vessels.
These are generally all sympathetic fibers, although some trigger vasodilation and others induce vasoconstriction, depending upon the nature of the neurotransmitter and receptors located on the target cell.
Parasympathetic stimulation does trigger vasodilation as well as erection during sexual arousal in the external genitalia of both sexes.
Nervous control over vessels tends to be more generalized than the specifictargetingofindividualbloodvessels.Localcontrols,discussedlater,accountforthisphenomenon.
(Seekadditional content for more information on these dynamic aspects of the autonomic nervous system.)
Hormones and local chemicals also control blood vessels.
Together, these neural and chemical mechanisms reduce or increase blood flow in response to changing body conditions, from exercise to hydration.
Regulation of both blood flow and blood pressure is discussed in detail later in this chapter.
The smooth muscle layers of the tunica media are supported by a framework of collagenous fibers that also binds the tunica media to the inner and outer tunics.
Along with the collagenous fibers are large numbers of elastic fibers that appear as wavy lines in prepared slides.
Separating the tunica media from the outer tunica externa in larger arteries is the external elastic membrane (also called the external elastic lamina), which also appears wavy in slides.
This structure is not usually seen in smaller arteries, nor is it seen in veins.

This is normally the thickest tunic in veins and may be thicker than the tunica media in some larger arteries.
The outer layers of the tunica externa are not distinct but rather blend with the surrounding connective tissue outside the vessel, helping to hold the vessel in relative position.
If you are able to palpate some of the superficial veinsonyourupperlimbsandtrytomovethem,youwillfindthatthetunicaexternapreventsthis.Ifthetunicaexternadid not hold the vessel in place, any movement would likely result in disruption of blood flow .
Arteries Anarteryis a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart.
All arteries have relatively thick walls that can withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart.
However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls, containing a high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics.
This type of artery is known as an elastic artery (Figure 20.4).
Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic.
Their abundant elastic fibers allow them to expand, as blood pumped from the ventricles passes through them, and then to recoil after the surge has passed.
If artery walls were rigid and unable to expand and recoil, their resistance to blood flow would greatly increase and blood pressure would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump harder to increase the volume of blood expelled by each pump (the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure and flow.
Artery walls would have to become even thicker in response to this increased pressure.
The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure gradientthatdrivesthebloodthroughthearterialsystem.Anelasticarteryisalsoknownasaconductingartery,becausethe large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of blood from the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.
Figure 20.4 Types of Arteries and Arterioles Comparison of the walls of an elastic artery, a muscular artery, and an arteriole is shown.
In terms of scale, the diameter of an arteriole is measured in micrometers compared to millimeters for elastic and muscular arteries.
Farther from the heart, where the surge of blood has dampened, the percentage of elastic fibers in an artery‚Äôs tunica intima decreases and the amount of smooth muscle in its tunica media increases.
The artery at this point is described as842 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 amuscular artery.
The diameter of muscular arteries typically ranges from 0.1 mm to 10 mm.
Their thick tunica media allows muscular arteries to play a leading role in vasoconstriction.
In contrast, their decreased quantity of elastic fibers limits their ability to expand.
Fortunately, because the blood pressure has eased by the time it reaches these more distant vessels, elasticity has become less important.
Notice that although the distinctions between elastic and muscular arteries are important, there is no ‚Äúline of demarcation‚Äù where an elastic artery suddenly becomes muscular.
Rather, there is a gradual transition as the vascular tree repeatedlybranches.Inturn,musculararteriesbranchtodistributebloodtothevastnetworkofarterioles.Forthisreason,a muscular artery is also known as a distributing artery.
Arterioles Anarteriole is a very small artery that leads to a capillary.
Arterioles have the same three tunics as the larger vessels, but the thickness of each is greatly diminished.
The critical endothelial lining of the tunica intima is intact.
The tunica media is restricted to one or two smooth muscle cell layers in thickness.
The tunica externa remains but is very thin (see Figure 20.4).
With a lumen averaging 30 micrometers or less in diameter, arterioles are critical in slowing down‚Äîor resisting‚Äîblood flow and, thus, causing a substantial drop in blood pressure.
Because of this, you may see them referred to as resistance vessels.
The muscle fibers in arterioles are normally slightly contracted, causing arterioles to maintain a consistent muscle tone‚Äîin this case referred to as vascular tone‚Äîin a similar manner to the muscular tone of skeletal muscle.Inreality,allbloodvesselsexhibitvasculartoneduetothepartialcontractionofsmoothmuscle.Theimportanceof the arterioles is that they will be the primary site of both resistance and regulation of blood pressure.
The precise diameter of the lumen of an arteriole at any given moment is determined by neural and chemical controls, and vasoconstriction and vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for distribution of blood flow .
Capillaries Acapillary is a microscopic channel that supplies blood to the tissues themselves, a process called perfusion.
Exchange of gases and other substances occurs in the capillaries between the blood and the surrounding cells and their tissue fluid (interstitial fluid).
The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 5‚Äì10 micrometers; the smallest are just barely wide enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through.
Flow through capillaries is often described as microcirculation .
The wall of a capillary consists of the endothelial layer surrounded by a basement membrane with occasional smooth muscle fibers.
There is some variation in wall structure: In a large capillary, several endothelial cells bordering each other may line the lumen; in a small capillary, there may be only a single cell layer that wraps around to contact itself.
For capillaries to function, their walls must be leaky, allowing substances to pass through.
There are three major types ofcapillaries,whichdifferaccordingtotheirdegreeof‚Äúleakiness:‚Äùcontinuous,fenestrated,andsinusoidcapillaries(Figure 20.5).
Continuous Capillaries The most common type of capillary, the continuous capillary , is found in almost all vascularized tissues.
Continuous capillariesarecharacterizedbyacompleteendothelialliningwithtightjunctionsbetweenendothelialcells.Althoughatight junction is usually impermeable and only allows for the passage of water and ions, they are often incomplete in capillaries, leaving intercellular clefts that allow for exchange of water and other very small molecules between the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid.
Substances that can pass between cells include metabolic products, such as glucose, water, and small hydrophobic molecules like gases and hormones, as well as various leukocytes.
Continuous capillaries not associated with the brain are rich in transport vesicles, contributing to either endocytosis or exocytosis.
Those in the brain are part of the blood-brainbarrier.Here,therearetightjunctionsandnointercellularclefts,plusathickbasementmembraneandastrocyte extensions called end feet; these structures combine to prevent the movement of nearly all substances.
Figure 20.5 Types of Capillaries The three major types of capillaries: continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoid.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 843 Fenestrated Capillaries Afenestrated capillary is one that has pores (or fenestrations) in addition to tight junctions in the endothelial lining.
Thesemakethecapillarypermeabletolargermolecules.Thenumberoffenestrationsandtheirdegreeofpermeabilityvary, however, according to their location.
Fenestrated capillaries are common in the small intestine, which is the primary site of nutrient absorption, as well as in the kidneys, which filter the blood.
They are also found in the choroid plexus of the brain and many endocrine structures, including the hypothalamus, pituitary , pineal, and thyroid glands.
Sinusoid Capillaries Asinusoid capillary (or sinusoid) is the least common type of capillary.
Sinusoid capillaries are flattened, and they have extensive intercellular gaps and incomplete basement membranes, in addition to intercellular clefts and fenestrations.
This gives them an appearance not unlike Swiss cheese.
These very large openings allow for the passage of the largest molecules, including plasma proteins and even cells.
Blood flow through sinusoids is very slow, allowing more time for exchangeofgases,nutrients,andwastes.Sinusoidsarefoundintheliverandspleen,bonemarrow,lymphnodes(wherethey carry lymph, not blood), and many endocrine glands including the pituitary and adrenal glands.

Metarterioles and Capillary Beds Ametarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and a capillary.
Slightly larger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries.
Each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10‚Äì100 capillaries.
Theprecapillary sphincters , circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies.
Their function is critical: If all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself.
Normally, the precapillary sphincters are closed.
When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more ( Figure 20.6 ).
If all of the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare channelandthenintothevenouscirculation,bypassingthecapillarybedentirely.Thiscreateswhatisknownasa vascular shunt.
In addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system.
Although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular, pulsating flow.
This pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to changes in internal conditions, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels.
For example, during strenuous exercise when oxygen levels decrease and carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels all increase, the capillary beds in skeletal muscle are open, as they would be in the digestive system when nutrients are present in the digestive tract.
During sleep or rest periods, vessels in both areas are largely closed; they open only occasionally to allow oxygen and nutrient supplies to travel to the tissues to maintain basic life processes.844 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 20.6 Capillary Bed In a capillary bed, arterioles give rise to metarterioles.
Precapillary sphincters located at the junction of a metarteriole with a capillary regulate blood flow.
A thoroughfare channel connects the metarteriole to a venule.
An arteriovenous anastomosis, which directly connects the arteriole with the venule, is shown at the bottom.
Venules Avenuleis an extremely small vein, generally 8‚Äì100 micrometers in diameter.
Postcapillary venules join multiple capillaries exiting from a capillary bed.
Multiple venules join to form veins.
The walls of venules consist of endothelium, a thin middle layer with a few muscle cells and elastic fibers, plus an outer layer of connective tissue fibers that constitute a very thin tunica externa (Figure 20.7).
Venules as well as capillaries are the primary sites of emigration or diapedesis, in which the white blood cells adhere to the endothelial lining of the vessels and then squeeze through adjacent cells to enter the tissue fluid.
Veins Aveinisabloodvesselthatconductsbloodtowardtheheart.Comparedtoarteries,veinsarethin-walledvesselswithlarge and irregular lumens (see Figure 20.7).
Because they are low-pressure vessels, larger veins are commonly equipped with valves that promote the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart and prevent backflow toward the capillaries caused by the inherent low blood pressure in veins as well as the pull of gravity.
Table 20.2 compares the features of arteries and veins.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 845 Figure 20.7 Comparison of Veins and Venules Many veins have valves to prevent back flow of blood, whereas venules do not.

Increased pressure will promote the flow of fluids out of the capillaries and into the interstitial fluid.
The presence of excess tissue fluid around the cells leads to a condition called edema.
Most people experience a daily accumulation of tissue fluid, especially if they spend much of their work life on theirfeet(likemosthealthprofessionals).However,clinicaledemagoesbeyondnormalswellingandrequiresmedical treatment.
Edema has many potential causes, including hypertension and heart failure, severe protein deficiency, renal failure, and many others.
In order to treat edema, which is a sign rather than a discrete disorder, the underlying cause must be diagnosed and alleviated.
Figure 20.8 Varicose Veins Varicose veins are commonly found in the lower limbs.
(credit: Thomas Kriese) Edema may be accompanied by varicose veins, especially in the superficial veins of the legs (Figure 20.8).
This disorder arises when defective valves allow blood to accumulate within the veins, causing them to distend, twist, and become visible on the surface of the integument.
Varicose veins may occur in both sexes, but are more common in women and are often related to pregnancy.
More than simple cosmetic blemishes, varicose veins are often painful and sometimes itchy or throbbing.
Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time.
The use of support hose, as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be helpful in alleviating this condition.
Laser surgery and interventional radiologic procedures can reduce the size and severity of varicose veins.
Severe cases may require conventional surgery to remove the damaged vessels.
As there are typically redundant circulation patterns, that is, anastomoses, for the smaller and more superficial veins, removal does not typically impair the circulation.
There is evidence that patients with varicose veins suffer a greater risk of developing a thrombus or clot.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 847 Veins as Blood Reservoirs In addition to their primary function of returning blood to the heart, veins may be considered blood reservoirs, since systemicveinscontainapproximately64percentofthebloodvolumeatanygiventime(Figure20.9).Theirabilitytohold this much blood is due to their high capacitance, that is, their capacity to distend (expand) readily to store a high volume of blood, even at a low pressure.
The large lumens and relatively thin walls of veins make them far more distensible than arteries; thus, they are said to be capacitance vessels.
Figure 20.9 Distribution of Blood Flow When blood flow needs to be redistributed to other portions of the body, the vasomotor center located in the medulla oblongata sends sympathetic stimulation to the smooth muscles in the walls of the veins, causing constriction‚Äîor in this case,venoconstriction.Lessdramaticthanthevasoconstrictionseeninsmallerarteriesandarterioles,venoconstrictionmay belikenedtoa‚Äústiffening‚Äùofthevesselwall.Thisincreasespressureonthebloodwithintheveins,speedingitsreturntothe heart.
As you will note in Figure 20.9, approximately 21 percent of the venous blood is located in venous networks within the liver, bone marrow, and integument.
This volume of blood is referred to as venous reserve .
Through venoconstriction, this ‚Äúreserve‚Äù volume of blood can get back to the heart more quickly for redistribution to other parts of the circulation.848 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Vascular Surgeons and Technicians Vascular surgery is a specialty in which the physician deals primarily with diseases of the vascular portion of the cardiovascular system.

20.2|Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Distinguish between systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure ‚Ä¢Describe the clinical measurement of pulse and blood pressure ‚Ä¢Identify and discuss five variables affecting arterial blood flow and blood pressure ‚Ä¢Discuss several factors affecting blood flow in the venous systemCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 849 Blood flow refers to the movement of blood through a vessel, tissue, or organ, and is usually expressed in terms of volume of blood per unit of time.
It is initiated by the contraction of the ventricles of the heart.
Ventricular contraction ejects blood into the major arteries, resulting in flow from regions of higher pressure to regions of lower pressure, as blood encounters smaller arteries and arterioles, then capillaries, then the venules and veins of the venous system.
This section discusses a number of critical variables that contribute to blood flow throughout the body.
It also discusses the factors that impede or slow blood flow, a phenomenon known as resistance.
As noted earlier, hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by a fluid due to gravitational pull, usually against the wall of the containerin which it is located.One form of hydrostatic pressure is blood pressure, the force exerted by blood upon the walls of the blood vessels or the chambers of the heart.
Blood pressure may be measured in capillaries and veins, as wellasthevesselsofthepulmonarycirculation;however,thetermbloodpressurewithoutanyspecificdescriptorstypically refers to systemic arterial blood pressure‚Äîthat is, the pressure of blood flowing in the arteries of the systemic circulation.
In clinical practice, this pressure is measured in mm Hg and is usually obtained using the brachial artery of the arm.
Components of Arterial Blood Pressure Arterial blood pressure in the larger vessels consists of several distinct components (Figure 20.10): systolic and diastolic pressures, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure.
Systolic and Diastolic Pressures When systemic arterial blood pressure is measured, it is recorded as a ratio of two numbers (e.g., 120/80 is a normal adult blood pressure), expressed as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.
The systolic pressure is the higher value (typically around 120 mm Hg) and reflects the arterial pressure resulting from the ejection of blood during ventricular contraction, or systole.
The diastolic pressure is the lower value (usually about 80 mm Hg) and represents the arterial pressure of blood during ventricular relaxation, or diastole.
Figure 20.10 Systemic Blood Pressure The graph shows the components of blood pressure throughout the blood vessels, including systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, and pulse pressures.
Pulse Pressure Asshownin Figure20.10,thedifferencebetweenthesystolicpressureandthediastolicpressureisthe pulsepressure.For example, an individual with a systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg would have a pulse pressure of 40 mmHg.
Generally, a pulse pressure should be at least 25 percent of the systolic pressure.
A pulse pressure below this level is described as low or narrow.
This may occur, for example, in patients with a low stroke volume, which may be seen in congestive heart failure, stenosis of the aortic valve, or significant blood loss following trauma.
In contrast, a high or wide pulse pressure is common in healthy people following strenuous exercise, when their resting pulse pressure of 30‚Äì40 mm Hg may increase temporarily to 100 mm Hg as stroke volume increases.
A persistently high pulse pressure at or above 100 mm Hg may indicate excessive resistance in the arteries and can be caused by a variety of disorders.
Chronic high resting pulse pressures can degrade the heart, brain, and kidneys, and warrant medical treatment.850 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Mean Arterial Pressure Meanarterialpressure(MAP) representsthe‚Äúaverage‚Äùpressureofbloodinthearteries,thatis,theaverageforcedriving blood into vessels that serve the tissues.
Mean is a statistical concept and is calculated by taking the sum of the values divided by the number of values.
Although complicated to measure directly and complicated to calculate, MAP can be approximated by adding the diastolic pressure to one-third of the pulse pressure or systolic pressure minus the diastolic pressure: MAP = diastolic BP + (systolic-diastolic BP) 3 InFigure20.10,thisvalueisapproximately80+(120‚àí80)/3,or93.33.Normally,theMAPfallswithintherangeof 70‚Äì110 mm Hg.
If the value falls below 60 mm Hg for an extended time, blood pressure will not be high enough to ensure circulation to and through the tissues, which results in ischemia, or insufficient blood flow.
A condition called hypoxia, inadequateoxygenationoftissues,commonlyaccompaniesischemia.Thetermhypoxemiareferstolowlevelsofoxygenin systemic arterial blood.
Neurons are especially sensitive to hypoxia and may die or be damaged if blood flow and oxygen supplies are not quickly restored.
Pulse After blood is ejected from the heart, elastic fibers in the arteries help maintain a high-pressure gradient as they expand to accommodate the blood, then recoil.
This expansion and recoiling effect, known as the pulse, can be palpated manually or measured electronically.
Although the effect diminishes over distance from the heart, elements of the systolic and diastolic components of the pulse are still evident down to the level of the arterioles.
Because pulse indicates heart rate, it is measured clinically to provide clues to a patient‚Äôs state of health.
It is recorded as beats per minute.
Both the rate and the strength of the pulse are important clinically.
A high or irregular pulse rate can be caused by physical activity or other temporary factors, but it may also indicate a heart condition.
The pulse strength indicates the strength of ventricular contraction and cardiac output.
If the pulse is strong, then systolic pressure is high.
If it is weak, systolic pressure has fallen, and medical intervention may be warranted.
Pulse can be palpated manually by placing the tips of the fingers across an artery that runs close to the body surface and pressing lightly.
While this procedure is normally performed using the radial artery in the wrist or the common carotid artery in the neck, any superficial artery that can be palpated may be used (Figure 20.11).
Common sites to find a pulse include temporal and facial arteries in the head, brachial arteries in the upper arm, femoral arteries in the thigh, popliteal arteries behind the knees, posterior tibial arteries near the medial tarsal regions, and dorsalis pedis arteries in the feet.
A variety of commercial electronic devices are also available to measure pulse.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 851 Figure 20.11 Pulse Sites The pulse is most readily measured at the radial artery, but can be measured at any of the pulse points shown.
Measurement of Blood Pressure Blood pressure is one of the critical parameters measured on virtually every patient in every healthcare setting.
The technique used today was developed more than 100 years ago by a pioneering Russian physician, Dr. Nikolai Korotkoff.
Turbulent blood flow through the vessels can be heard as a soft ticking while measuring blood pressure; these sounds are known as Korotkoff sounds .
The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope.
The technique is as follows: ‚Ä¢The clinician wraps an inflatable cuff tightly around the patient‚Äôs arm at about the level of the heart.
‚Ä¢The clinician squeezes a rubber pump to inject air into the cuff, raising pressure around the artery and temporarily cutting off blood flow into the patient‚Äôs arm.
‚Ä¢The clinician places the stethoscope on the patient‚Äôs antecubital region and, while gradually allowing air within the cuff to escape, listens for the Korotkoff sounds.
Although there are five recognized Korotkoff sounds, only two are normally recorded.
Initially, no sounds are heard sincethereisnobloodflowthroughthevessels,butasairpressuredrops,thecuffrelaxes,andbloodflowreturnstothearm.
As shown in Figure 20.12, the first sound heard through the stethoscope‚Äîthe first Korotkoff sound‚Äîindicates systolic pressure.
As more air is released from the cuff, blood is able to flow freely through the brachial artery and all sounds disappear.
The point at which the last sound is heard is recorded as the patient‚Äôs diastolic pressure.852 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 20.12 Blood Pressure Measurement When pressure in a sphygmomanometer cuff is released, a clinician can hear the Korotkoff sounds.
In this graph, a blood pressure tracing is aligned to a measurement of systolic and diastolic pressures.
The majority of hospitals and clinics have automated equipment for measuring blood pressure that work on the same principles.Anevenmorerecentinnovationisasmallinstrumentthatwrapsaroundapatient‚Äôswrist.Thepatientthenholds the wrist over the heart while the device measures blood flow and records pressure.
Variables Affecting Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Five variables influence blood flow and blood pressure: ‚Ä¢Cardiac output ‚Ä¢Compliance ‚Ä¢Volume of the blood ‚Ä¢Viscosity of the blood ‚Ä¢Blood vessel length and diameter Recall that blood moves from higher pressure to lower pressure.
It is pumped from the heart into the arteries at high pressure.
If you increase pressure in the arteries (afterload), and cardiac function does not compensate, blood flow will actually decrease.
In the venous system, the opposite relationship is true.
Increased pressure in the veins does not decrease flow as it does in arteries, but actually increases flow.
Since pressure in the veins is normally relatively low, for blood to flow back into the heart, the pressure in the atria during atrial diastole must be even lower.
It normally approaches zero, except when the atria contract (see Figure 20.10 ).
Cardiac Output Cardiac output is the measurement of blood flow from the heart through the ventricles, and is usually measured in liters per minute.
Any factor that causes cardiac output to increase, by elevating heart rate or stroke volume or both, will elevate bloodpressureandpromotebloodflow.Thesefactorsincludesympatheticstimulation,thecatecholaminesepinephrineand norepinephrine, thyroid hormones, and increased calcium ion levels.
Conversely, any factor that decreases cardiac output, by decreasing heart rate or stroke volume or both, will decrease arterial pressure and blood flow.
These factors include parasympathetic stimulation, elevated or decreased potassium ion levels, decreased calcium levels, anoxia, and acidosis.
Compliance Compliance is the ability of any compartment to expand to accommodate increased content.
A metal pipe, for example, is not compliant, whereas a balloon is.
The greater the compliance of an artery, the more effectively it is able to expand to accommodate surges in blood flow without increased resistance or blood pressure.
Veins are more compliant than arteries and can expand to hold more blood.
When vascular disease causes stiffening of arteries, compliance is reduced and resistance to blood flow is increased.
The result is more turbulence, higher pressure within the vessel, and reduced blood flow.
This increases the work of the heart.
A Mathematical Approach to Factors Affecting Blood Flow Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille was a French physician and physiologist who devised a mathematical equation describing blood flow and its relationship to known parameters.
The same equation also applies to engineering studies of the flow of fluids.AlthoughunderstandingthemathbehindtherelationshipsamongthefactorsaffectingbloodflowisnotnecessarytoCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 853 understandbloodflow,itcanhelpsolidifyanunderstandingoftheirrelationships.Pleasenotethateveniftheequationlooks intimidating, breaking it down into its components and following the relationships will make these relationships clearer, even if you are weak in math.
Focus on the three critical variables: radius (r), vessel length (Œª), and viscosity (Œ∑).
Poiseuille‚Äôs equation: Blood flo w = œÄ ŒîP r4 8Œ∑Œª ‚Ä¢œÄ is the Greek letter pi, used to represent the mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle‚Äôs circumference to its diameter.
It may commonly be represented as 3.14, although the actual number extends to infinity.
‚Ä¢ŒîP represents the difference in pressure.
‚Ä¢r4is the radius (one-half of the diameter) of the vessel to the fourth power .
‚Ä¢Œ∑ is the Greek letter eta and represents the viscosity of the blood.
‚Ä¢Œª is the Greek letter lambda and represents the length of a blood vessel.
One of several things this equation allows us to do is calculate the resistance in the vascular system.
Normally this value is extremely difficult to measure, but it can be calculated from this known relationship: Blood flo w = ŒîP Resistance If we rearrange this slightly, Resistance = ŒîP Blood flo w Then by substituting Pouseille‚Äôs equation for blood flow: Resistance =8Œ∑Œª œÄr4 By examining this equation, you can see that there are only three variables: viscosity, vessel length, and radius, since 8 and œÄ are both constants.
The important thing to remember is this: Two of these variables, viscosity and vessel length, will change slowly in the body.
Only one of these factors, the radius, can be changed rapidly by vasoconstriction and vasodilation, thus dramatically impacting resistance and flow.
Further, small changes in the radius will greatly affect flow, since it is raised to the fourth power in the equation.
We have briefly considered how cardiac output and blood volume impact blood flow and pressure; the next step is to seehowtheothervariables(contraction,vessellength,andviscosity)articulatewithPouseille‚Äôsequationandwhattheycan teach us about the impact on blood flow.
Blood Volume The relationship between blood volume, blood pressure, and blood flow is intuitively obvious.
Water may merely trickle along a creek bed in a dry season, but rush quickly and under great pressure after a heavy rain.
Similarly, as blood volume decreases, pressure and flow decrease.
As blood volume increases, pressure and flow increase.
Under normal circumstances, blood volume varies little.
Low blood volume, called hypovolemia, may be caused by bleeding, dehydration, vomiting, severe burns, or some medications used to treat hypertension.
It is important to recognize that other regulatory mechanisms in the body are so effective at maintaining blood pressure that an individual may be asymptomatic until 10‚Äì20 percent of the blood volume has been lost.
Treatment typically includes intravenous fluid replacement.
Hypervolemia , excessive fluid volume, may be caused by retention of water and sodium, as seen in patients with heartfailure,livercirrhosis,someformsofkidneydisease,hyperaldosteronism,andsomeglucocorticoidsteroidtreatments.
Restoring homeostasis in these patients depends upon reversing the condition that triggered the hypervolemia.
Blood Viscosity Viscosity is the thickness of fluids that affects their ability to flow.
Clean water, for example, is less viscous than mud.
The viscosity of blood is directly proportional to resistance and inversely proportional to flow; therefore, any condition that causes viscosity to increase will also increase resistance and decrease flow.
For example, imagine sipping milk, then a milkshake, through the same size straw.
You experience more resistance and therefore less flow from the milkshake.
Conversely,anyconditionthatcausesviscositytodecrease(suchaswhenthemilkshakemelts)willdecreaseresistanceand increase flow.
Normally the viscosity of blood does not change over short periods of time.
The two primary determinants of blood viscosity are the formed elements and plasma proteins.
Since the vast majority of formed elements are erythrocytes, any condition affecting erythropoiesis, such as polycythemia or anemia, can alter viscosity.
Since most plasma proteins are produced by the liver, any condition affecting liver function can also change the viscosity slightly and therefore decreasebloodflow.Liverabnormalitiesincludehepatitis,cirrhosis,alcoholdamage,anddrugtoxicities.Whileleukocytes and platelets are normally a small component of the formed elements, there are some rare conditions in which severe overproduction can impact viscosity as well.854 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Vessel Length and Diameter Thelengthofavesselisdirectlyproportionaltoitsresistance:thelongerthevessel,thegreatertheresistanceandthelower the flow.
As with blood volume, this makes intuitive sense, since the increased surface area of the vessel will impede the flow of blood.
Likewise, if the vessel is shortened, the resistance will decrease and flow will increase.
The length of our blood vessels increases throughout childhood as we grow, of course, but is unchanging in adults under normal physiological circumstances.
Further, the distribution of vessels is not the same in all tissues.
Adipose tissue does not have an extensive vascular supply.
One pound of adipose tissue contains approximately 200 miles of vessels, whereas skeletal muscle contains more than twice that.
Overall, vessels decrease in length only during loss of mass or amputation.
An individual weighing 150 pounds has approximately 60,000 miles of vessels in the body.
Gaining about 10 pounds adds from 2000 to 4000 miles of vessels, depending upon the nature of the gained tissue.
One of the great benefits of weight reduction is the reduced stress to the heart, which does not have to overcome the resistance of as many miles of vessels.
Incontrasttolength,thediameterofbloodvesselschangesthroughoutthebody,accordingtothetypeofvessel,aswe discussedearlier.Thediameterofanygivenvesselmayalsochangefrequentlythroughoutthedayinresponsetoneuraland chemicalsignalsthattriggervasodilationandvasoconstriction.The vasculartone ofthevesselisthecontractilestateofthe smooth muscle and the primary determinant of diameter, and thus of resistance and flow.
The effect of vessel diameter on resistanceisinverse:Giventhesamevolumeofblood,anincreaseddiametermeansthereislessbloodcontactingthevessel wall,thuslowerfrictionandlowerresistance,subsequentlyincreasingflow.Adecreaseddiametermeansmoreoftheblood contacts the vessel wall, and resistance increases, subsequently decreasing flow .
The influence of lumen diameter on resistance is dramatic: A slight increase or decrease in diameter causes a huge decreaseorincreaseinresistance.Thisisbecauseresistanceisinverselyproportionaltotheradiusofthebloodvessel(one- half of the vessel‚Äôs diameter) raised to the fourth power (R = 1/r4).
This means, for example, that if an artery or arteriole constricts to one-half of its original radius, the resistance to flow will increase 16 times.
And if an artery or arteriole dilates to twice its initial radius, then resistance in the vessel will decrease to 1/16 of its original value and flow will increase 16 times.
The Roles of Vessel Diameter and Total Area in Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Recall that we classified arterioles as resistance vessels, because given their small lumen, they dramatically slow the flow of blood from arteries.
In fact, arterioles are the site of greatest resistance in the entire vascular network.
This may seem surprising, given that capillaries have a smaller size.
How can this phenomenon be explained?
Figure 20.13 compares vessel diameter, total cross-sectional area, average blood pressure, and blood velocity through the systemic vessels.
Notice in parts (a) and (b) that the total cross-sectional area of the body‚Äôs capillary beds is far greater than any other type of vessel.
Although the diameter of an individual capillary is significantly smaller than the diameter of an arteriole, there are vastly more capillaries in the body than there are other types of blood vessels.
Part (c) shows that blood pressure drops unevenly as blood travels from arteries to arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins, and encounters greater resistance.
However, the site of the most precipitous drop, and the site of greatest resistance, is the arterioles.
This explains why vasodilation and vasoconstriction of arterioles play more significant roles in regulating blood pressure than do the vasodilation and vasoconstriction of other vessels.
Part (d) shows that the velocity (speed) of blood flow decreases dramatically as the blood moves from arteries to arterioles to capillaries.
This slow flow rate allows more time for exchange processes to occur.
As blood flows through the veins, the rate of velocity increases, as blood is returned to the heart.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 855 Figure 20.13 Relationships among Vessels in the Systemic Circuit The relationships among blood vessels that can be compared include (a) vessel diameter, (b) total cross-sectional area, (c) average blood pressure, and (d) velocity of blood flow.856 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Cardiovascular System: Arteriosclerosis Compliance allows an artery to expand when blood is pumped through it from the heart, and then to recoil after the surgehaspassed.Thishelpspromotebloodflow.Inarteriosclerosis,complianceisreduced,andpressureandresistance within the vessel increase.
This is a leading cause of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as it causes the heart to work harder to generate a pressure great enough to overcome the resistance.
Arteriosclerosis begins with injury to the endothelium of an artery, which may be caused by irritation from high bloodglucose,infection,tobaccouse,excessivebloodlipids,andotherfactors.Arterywallsthatareconstantlystressed by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured‚Äîwhich means that hypertension can promote arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it.
Recall that tissue injury causes inflammation.
As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars it,leavingitstiff(sclerotic).Asaresult,complianceisreduced.Moreover,circulatingtriglyceridesandcholesterolcan seep between the damaged lining cells and become trapped within the artery wall, where they are frequently joined by leukocytes, calcium, and cellular debris.
Eventually, this buildup, called plaque, can narrow arteries enough to impair blood flow.
The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- = ‚Äúporridge‚Äù) describes the mealy deposits (Figure 20.14).
Figure 20.14 Atherosclerosis (a) Atherosclerosis can result from plaques formed by the buildup of fatty, calcified deposits in an artery.
(b) Plaques can also take other forms, as shown in this micrograph of a coronary artery that has a buildup of connective tissue within the artery wall.
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) Sometimes a plaque can rupture, causing microscopic tears in the artery wall that allow blood to leak into the tissueontheotherside.Whenthishappens,plateletsrushtothesitetoclottheblood.Thisclotcanfurtherobstructthe artery and‚Äîif it occurs in a coronary or cerebral artery‚Äîcause a sudden heart attack or stroke.
Alternatively, plaque can break off and travel through the bloodstream as an embolus until it blocks a more distant, smaller artery.
Even without total blockage, vessel narrowing leads to ischemia‚Äîreduced blood flow‚Äîto the tissue region ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù of the narrowed vessel.
Ischemia in turn leads to hypoxia‚Äîdecreased supply of oxygen to the tissues.
Hypoxia involving cardiac muscle or brain tissue can lead to cell death and severe impairment of brain or heart function.
Amajorriskfactorforbotharteriosclerosisandatherosclerosisisadvancedage,astheconditionstendtoprogress overtime.Arteriosclerosisisnormallydefinedasthemoregeneralizedlossofcompliance,‚Äúhardeningofthearteries,‚Äù whereas atherosclerosis is a more specific term for the build-up of plaque in the walls of the vessel and is a specific type of arteriosclerosis.
There is also a distinct genetic component, and pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes also greatly increase the risk.
However, obesity, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use all are major risk factors.
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adoption of a diet low in sodium and saturated fats.
Medications to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure may be prescribed.
For blocked coronary arteries, surgery is warranted.
In angioplasty, a catheter is inserted into the vessel at the pointCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 857 of narrowing, and a second catheter with a balloon-like tip is inflated to widen the opening.
To prevent subsequent collapse of the vessel, a small mesh tube called a stent is often inserted.
In an endarterectomy, plaque is surgically removedfromthewallsofavessel.Thisoperationistypicallyperformedonthecarotidarteriesoftheneck,whichare a prime source of oxygenated blood for the brain.
In a coronary bypass procedure, a non-vital superficial vessel from another part of the body (often the great saphenous vein) or a synthetic vessel is inserted to create a path around the blocked area of a coronary artery.
Venous System Thepumpingactionoftheheartpropelsthebloodintothearteries,fromanareaofhigherpressuretowardanareaoflower pressure.
If blood is to flow from the veins back into the heart, the pressure in the veins must be greater than the pressure intheatriaoftheheart.Twofactorshelpmaintainthispressuregradientbetweentheveinsandtheheart.First,thepressure in the atria during diastole is very low, often approaching zero when the atria are relaxed (atrial diastole).
Second, two physiologic ‚Äúpumps‚Äù increase pressure in the venous system.
The use of the term ‚Äúpump‚Äù implies a physical device that speeds flow.
These physiological pumps are less obvious.
Skeletal Muscle Pump Inmanybodyregions,thepressurewithintheveinscanbeincreasedbythecontractionofthesurroundingskeletalmuscle.
This mechanism, known as the skeletal muscle pump (Figure 20.15), helps the lower-pressure veins counteract the force of gravity, increasing pressure to move blood back to the heart.
As leg muscles contract, for example during walking or running, they exert pressure on nearby veins with their numerous one-way valves.
This increased pressure causes blood to flow upward, opening valves superior to the contracting muscles so blood flows through.
Simultaneously, valves inferior to the contracting muscles close; thus, blood should not seep back downward toward the feet.
Military recruits are trained to flex their legs slightly while standing at attention for prolonged periods.
Failure to do so may allow blood to pool in the lower limbs rather than returning to the heart.
Consequently, the brain will not receive enough oxygenated blood, and the individual may lose consciousness.
Figure 20.15 Skeletal Muscle Pump The contraction of skeletal muscles surrounding a vein compresses the blood and increases the pressure in that area.
This action forces blood closer to the heart where venous pressure is lower.
Note the importance of the one-way valves to assure that blood flows only in the proper direction.
Respiratory Pump Therespiratory pump aids blood flow through the veins of the thorax and abdomen.
During inhalation, the volume of the thorax increases, largely through the contraction of the diaphragm, which moves downward and compresses the abdominal cavity.
The elevation of the chest caused by the contraction of the external intercostal muscles also contributes to the increasedvolumeofthethorax.Thevolumeincreasecausesairpressurewithinthethoraxtodecrease,allowingustoinhale.
Additionally, as air pressure within the thorax drops, blood pressure in the thoracic veins also decreases, falling below the pressure in the abdominal veins.
This causes blood to flow along its pressure gradient from veins outside the thorax, where858 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 pressure is higher, into the thoracic region, where pressure is now lower.
This in turn promotes the return of blood from the thoracicveinstotheatria.Duringexhalation,whenairpressureincreaseswithinthethoraciccavity,pressureinthethoracic veinsincreases,speedingbloodflowintotheheartwhilevalvesintheveinspreventbloodfromflowingbackwardfromthe thoracic and abdominal veins.
Pressure Relationships in the Venous System Although vessel diameter increases from the smaller venules to the larger veins and eventually to the venae cavae (singular = vena cava), the total cross-sectional area actually decreases (see Figure 20.15a andb).
The individual veins are larger in diameter than the venules, but their total number is much lower, so their total cross-sectional area is also lower.
Also notice that, as blood moves from venules to veins, the average blood pressure drops (see Figure 20.15c), but the blood velocity actually increases (see Figure 20.15).
This pressure gradient drives blood back toward the heart.
Again, the presence of one-way valves and the skeletal muscle and respiratory pumps contribute to this increased flow.
Since approximately 64 percent of the total blood volume resides in systemic veins, any action that increases the flow of blood through the veins will increase venous return to the heart.
Maintaining vascular tone within the veins prevents the veins from merely distending, dampening the flow of blood, and as you will see, vasoconstriction actually enhances the flow .
The Role of Venoconstriction in Resistance, Blood Pressure, and Flow As previously discussed, vasoconstriction of an artery or arteriole decreases the radius, increasing resistance and pressure, but decreasing flow.
Venoconstriction, on the other hand, has a very different outcome.
The walls of veins are thin but irregular; thus, when the smooth muscle in those walls constricts, the lumen becomes more rounded.
The more rounded the lumen, the less surface area the blood encounters, and the less resistance the vessel offers.
Vasoconstriction increases pressure within a vein as it does in an artery, but in veins, the increased pressure increases flow.
Recall that the pressure in the atria, into which the venous blood will flow, is very low, approaching zero for at least part of the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle.
Thus, venoconstriction increases the return of blood to the heart.
Another way of stating this is that venoconstriction increases the preload or stretch of the cardiac muscle and increases contraction.
20.3|Capillary Exchange By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the primary mechanisms of capillary exchange ‚Ä¢Distinguish between capillary hydrostatic pressure and blood colloid osmotic pressure, explaining the contribution of each to net filtration pressure ‚Ä¢Compare filtration and reabsorption ‚Ä¢Explain the fate of fluid that is not reabsorbed from the tissues into the vascular capillaries The primary purpose of the cardiovascular system is to circulate gases, nutrients, wastes, and other substances to and from the cells of the body.
Small molecules, such as gases, lipids, and lipid-soluble molecules, can diffuse directly through the membranes of the endothelial cells of the capillary wall.
Glucose, amino acids, and ions‚Äîincluding sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride‚Äîuse transporters to move through specific channels in the membrane by facilitated diffusion.
Glucose,ions,andlargermoleculesmayalsoleavethebloodthroughintercellularclefts.Largermoleculescanpassthrough the pores of fenestrated capillaries, and even large plasma proteins can pass through the great gaps in the sinusoids.
Some large proteins in blood plasma can move into and out of the endothelial cells packaged within vesicles by endocytosis and exocytosis.
Water moves by osmosis.
Bulk Flow The mass movement of fluids into and out of capillary beds requires a transport mechanism far more efficient than mere diffusion.Thismovement,oftenreferredtoasbulkflow,involvestwopressure-drivenmechanisms:Volumesoffluidmove from an area of higher pressure in a capillary bed to an area of lower pressure in the tissues via filtration.
In contrast, the movement of fluid from an area of higher pressure in the tissues into an area of lower pressure in the capillaries is reabsorption.
Two types of pressure interact to drive each of these movements: hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure.
Hydrostatic Pressure The primary force driving fluid transport between the capillaries and tissues is hydrostatic pressure, which can be defined as the pressure of any fluid enclosed in a space.
Blood hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by the blood confined withinbloodvesselsorheartchambers.Evenmorespecifically,thepressureexertedbybloodagainstthewallofacapillary is calledcapillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP), and is the same as capillary blood pressure.
CHP is the force that drives fluid out of capillaries and into the tissues.
As fluid exits a capillary and moves into tissues, the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid correspondingly rises.
This opposing hydrostatic pressure is called the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP) .
Generally, the CHP originating from the arterial pathways is considerably higher than the IFHP, because lymphatic vessels are continuallyCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 859 absorbing excess fluid from the tissues.
Thus, fluid generally moves out of the capillary and into the interstitial fluid.
This process is called filtration.
Osmotic Pressure The net pressure that drives reabsorption‚Äîthe movement of fluid from the interstitial fluid back into the capillaries‚Äîis called osmotic pressure (sometimes referred to as oncotic pressure).
Whereas hydrostatic pressure forces fluid out of the capillary, osmotic pressure draws fluid back in.
Osmotic pressure is determined by osmotic concentration gradients, that is, thedifferenceinthesolute-to-waterconcentrationsinthebloodandtissuefluid.Aregionhigherinsoluteconcentration(and lower in water concentration) draws water across a semipermeable membrane from a region higher in water concentration (and lower in solute concentration).
Aswediscussosmoticpressureinbloodandtissuefluid,itisimportanttorecognizethattheformedelementsofblood do not contribute to osmotic concentration gradients.
Rather, it is the plasma proteins that play the key role.
Solutes also move across the capillary wall according to their concentration gradient, but overall, the concentrations should be similar and not have a significant impact on osmosis.
Because of their large size and chemical structure, plasma proteins are not trulysolutes,thatis,theydonotdissolvebutaredispersedorsuspendedintheirfluidmedium,formingacolloidratherthan a solution.
The pressure created by the concentration of colloidal proteins in the blood is called the blood colloidal osmotic pressure (BCOP).
Its effect on capillary exchange accounts for the reabsorption of water.
The plasma proteins suspended in blood cannot move across the semipermeable capillary cell membrane, and so they remain in the plasma.
As a result, bloodhasahighercolloidalconcentrationandlowerwaterconcentrationthantissuefluid.Itthereforeattractswater.Wecan alsosaythattheBCOPishigherthanthe interstitialfluidcolloidalosmoticpressure(IFCOP),whichisalwaysverylow because interstitial fluid contains few proteins.
Thus, water is drawn from the tissue fluid back into the capillary, carrying dissolved molecules with it.
This difference in colloidal osmotic pressure accounts for reabsorption.

NFP changes at different points in a capillary bed ( Figure 20.16 ).

Near the venous end of the capillary, the CHP has dwindled to about 18 mm Hg due to loss of fluid.
Because the BCOP remains steady at 25 mm Hg, water is drawn into the capillary, that is, reabsorption occurs.
Another way of expressing this is to say that at the venous end of the capillary, there is an NFP of ‚àí7 mm Hg.860 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 20.16 Capillary Exchange Net filtration occurs near the arterial end of the capillary since capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP) is greater than blood colloidal osmotic pressure (BCOP).
There is no net movement of fluid near the midpoint since CHP = BCOP.
Net reabsorption occurs near the venous end since BCOP is greater than CHP.
The Role of Lymphatic Capillaries Since overall CHP is higher than BCOP, it is inevitable that more net fluid will exit the capillary through filtration at the arterialendthanentersthroughreabsorptionatthevenousend.Consideringallcapillariesoverthecourseofaday,thiscan be quite a substantial amount of fluid: Approximately 24 liters per day are filtered, whereas 20.4 liters are reabsorbed.

20.4|Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Discuss the mechanisms involved in the neural regulation of vascular homeostasis ‚Ä¢Describe the contribution of a variety of hormones to the renal regulation of blood pressure ‚Ä¢Identify the effects of exercise on vascular homeostasis ‚Ä¢Discuss how hypertension, hemorrhage, and circulatory shock affect vascular health In order to maintain homeostasis in the cardiovascular system and provide adequate blood to the tissues, blood flow must be redirected continually to the tissues as they become more active.
In a very real sense, the cardiovascular system engages in resource allocation, because there is not enough blood flow to distribute blood equally to all tissues simultaneously.
For example, when an individual is exercising, more blood will be directed to skeletal muscles, the heart, and the lungs.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 861 Following a meal, more blood is directed to the digestive system.
Only the brain receives a more or less constant supply of blood whether you are active, resting, thinking, or engaged in any other activity .
Table 20.3 provides the distribution of systemic blood at rest and during exercise.
Although most of the data appears logical,thevaluesforthedistributionofbloodtotheintegumentmayseemsurprising.Duringexercise,thebodydistributes more blood to the body surface where it can dissipate the excess heat generated by increased activity into the environment.

They are summarized in Figure 20.17 .862 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 20.17 Summary of Factors Maintaining Vascular Homeostasis Adequate blood flow, blood pressure, distribution, and perfusion involve autoregulatory, neural, and endocrine mechanisms.
Neural Regulation The nervous system plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis.
The primary regulatory sites include the cardiovascular centers in the brain that control both cardiac and vascular functions.
In addition, more generalized neural responses from the limbic system and the autonomic nervous system are factors.
The Cardiovascular Centers in the Brain Neurologicalregulationofbloodpressureandflowdependsonthecardiovascularcenterslocatedinthemedullaoblongata.
This cluster of neurons responds to changes in blood pressure as well as blood concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions.
The cardiovascular center contains three distinct paired components: ‚Ä¢The cardioaccelerator centers stimulate cardiac function by regulating heart rate and stroke volume via sympathetic stimulation from the cardiac accelerator nerve.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 863 ‚Ä¢The cardioinhibitor centers slow cardiac function by decreasing heart rate and stroke volume via parasympathetic stimulation from the vagus nerve.
‚Ä¢The vasomotor centers control vessel tone or contraction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media.
Changes in diameter affect peripheral resistance, pressure, and flow, which affect cardiac output.
The majority of these neurons act via the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons.
Although each center functions independently, they are not anatomically distinct.
There is also a small population of neurons that control vasodilation in the vessels of the brain and skeletal muscles by relaxing the smooth muscle fibers in the vessel tunics.
Many of these are cholinergic neurons, that is, they release acetylcholine,whichinturnstimulatesthevessels‚Äôendothelialcellstoreleasenitricoxide(NO),whichcausesvasodilation.
Others release norepinephrine that binds to Œ≤ 2receptors.
A few neurons release NO directly as a neurotransmitter .
Recallthatmildstimulationoftheskeletalmusclesmaintainsmuscletone.Asimilarphenomenonoccurswithvascular tone in vessels.
As noted earlier, arterioles are normally partially constricted: With maximal stimulation, their radius may be reduced to one-half of the resting state.
Full dilation of most arterioles requires that this sympathetic stimulation be suppressed.
When it is, an arteriole can expand by as much as 150 percent.
Such a significant increase can dramatically affect resistance, pressure, and flow.
Baroreceptor Reflexes Baroreceptors are specialized stretch receptors located within thin areas of blood vessels and heart chambers that respond to the degree of stretch caused by the presence of blood.
They send impulses to the cardiovascular center to regulate blood pressure.
Vascular baroreceptors are found primarily in sinuses (small cavities) within the aorta and carotid arteries: The aorticsinuses arefoundinthewallsoftheascendingaortajustsuperiortotheaorticvalve,whereasthe carotidsinuses are inthebaseoftheinternalcarotidarteries.Therearealsolow-pressurebaroreceptorslocatedinthewallsofthevenaecavae and right atrium.
When blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors are stretched more tightly and initiate action potentials at a higher rate.Atlowerbloodpressures,thedegreeofstretchislowerandtherateoffiringisslower.Whenthecardiovascularcenter in the medulla oblongata receives this input, it triggers a reflex that maintains homeostasis ( Figure 20.18 ): ‚Ä¢When blood pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors fire at a higher rate and trigger parasympathetic stimulation of the heart.
As a result, cardiac output falls.
Sympathetic stimulation of the peripheral arterioles will also decrease, resulting in vasodilation.
Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to fall.
‚Ä¢When blood pressure drops too low, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases.
This will trigger an increase in sympathetic stimulation of the heart, causing cardiac output to increase.
It will also trigger sympathetic stimulation of the peripheral vessels, resulting in vasoconstriction.
Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to rise.864 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 20.18 Baroreceptor Reflexes for Maintaining Vascular Homeostasis Increased blood pressure results in increased rates of baroreceptor firing, whereas decreased blood pressure results in slower rates of fire, both initiating the homeostatic mechanism to restore blood pressure.
The baroreceptors in the venae cavae and right atrium monitor blood pressure as the blood returns to the heart from the systemic circulation.
Normally, blood flow into the aorta is the same as blood flow back into the right atrium.
If blood isreturningtotherightatriummorerapidlythanitisbeingejectedfromtheleftventricle,theatrialreceptorswillstimulate the cardiovascular centers to increase sympathetic firing and increase cardiac output until homeostasis is achieved.
The opposite is also true.
This mechanism is referred to as the atrial reflex.
Chemoreceptor Reflexes Inadditiontothebaroreceptorsarechemoreceptorsthatmonitorlevelsofoxygen,carbondioxide,andhydrogenions(pH), and thereby contribute to vascular homeostasis.
Chemoreceptors monitoring the blood are located in close proximity to the baroreceptorsintheaorticandcarotidsinuses.Theysignalthecardiovascularcenteraswellastherespiratorycentersinthe medulla oblongata.
Sincetissuesconsumeoxygenandproducecarbondioxideandacidsaswasteproducts,whenthebodyismoreactive, oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide levels rise as cells undergo cellular respiration to meet the energy needs of activities.
This causes more hydrogen ions to be produced, causing the blood pH to drop.
When the body is resting, oxygen levels are higher, carbon dioxide levels are lower, more hydrogen is bound, and pH rises.
(Seek additional content for more detail about pH.)
The chemoreceptors respond to increasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (falling pH) by stimulating the cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers, increasing cardiac output and constricting peripheral vessels.
The cardioinhibitor centers are suppressed.
With falling carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (increasing pH), the cardioinhibitor centers are stimulated, and the cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers are suppressed, decreasing cardiac output and causing peripheral vasodilation.
In order to maintain adequate supplies of oxygen to the cells and remove waste products such as carbondioxide,itisessentialthattherespiratorysystemrespondtochangingmetabolicdemands.Inturn,thecardiovascular system will transport these gases to the lungs for exchange, again in accordance with metabolic demands.
This interrelationship of cardiovascular and respiratory control cannot be overemphasized.
Other neural mechanisms can also have a significant impact on cardiovascular function.
These include the limbic system that links physiological responses to psychological stimuli, as well as generalized sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation.
Endocrine Regulation Endocrine control over the cardiovascular system involves the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as several hormones that interact with the kidneys in the regulation of blood volume.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 865 Epinephrine and Norepinephrine The catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla, and enhance and extend the body‚Äôssympatheticor‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äùresponse(see Figure20.17).Theyincreaseheartrateandforceofcontraction,while temporarily constricting blood vessels to organs not essential for flight-or-fight responses and redirecting blood flow to the liver, muscles, and heart.
Antidiuretic Hormone Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is secreted by the cells in the hypothalamus and transported via the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tracts to the posterior pituitary where it is stored until released upon nervous stimulation.
TheprimarytriggerpromptingthehypothalamustoreleaseADHisincreasingosmolarityoftissuefluid,usuallyinresponse to significant loss of blood volume.
ADH signals its target cells in the kidneys to reabsorb more water, thus preventing the loss of additional fluid in the urine.
This will increase overall fluid levels and help restore blood volume and pressure.
In addition, ADH constricts peripheral vessels.
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Mechanism The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism has a major effect upon the cardiovascular system (Figure 20.19).
Renin is an enzyme, although because of its importance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, some sources identify it as a hormone.
Specialized cells in the kidneys found in the juxtaglomerular apparatus respond to decreased blood flow by secreting renin into the blood.
Renin converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver, into its activeform‚ÄîangiotensinI.AngiotensinIcirculatesinthebloodandisthenconvertedintoangiotensinIIinthelungs.This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor, greatly increasing blood pressure.
It also stimulates the release of ADH andaldosterone,ahormoneproducedbytheadrenalcortex.Aldosteroneincreasesthereabsorptionofsodiumintotheblood by the kidneys.
Since water follows sodium, this increases the reabsorption of water.
This in turn increases blood volume, raising blood pressure.
Angiotensin II also stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, so an individual will likely consume more fluids, again increasing blood volume and pressure.
Figure 20.19 Hormones Involved in Renal Control of Blood Pressure In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism, increasing angiotensin II will stimulate the production of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone.
In addition to renin, the kidneys produce erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, further increasing blood volume.
Erythropoietin Erythropoietin (EPO) is released by the kidneys when blood flow and/or oxygen levels decrease.
EPO stimulates the production of erythrocytes within the bone marrow.
Erythrocytes are the major formed element of the blood and may contribute 40 percent or more to blood volume, a significant factor of viscosity, resistance, pressure, and flow.
In addition, EPO is a vasoconstrictor.
Overproduction of EPO or excessive intake of synthetic EPO, often to enhance athletic performance, will increase viscosity, resistance, and pressure, and decrease flow in addition to its contribution as a vasoconstrictor.
Atrial Natriuretic Hormone Secreted by cells in the atria of the heart, atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide) is secreted when blood volume is high enough to cause extreme stretching of the cardiac cells.
Cells in the ventricle produce a hormone with similar effects, called B-type natriuretic hormone.
Natriuretic hormones are antagonists to angiotensin II.866 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Theypromotelossofsodiumandwaterfromthekidneys,andsuppressrenin,aldosterone,andADHproductionandrelease.
All of these actions promote loss of fluid from the body, so blood volume and blood pressure drop.
Autoregulation of Perfusion As the name would suggest, autoregulation mechanisms require neither specialized nervous stimulation nor endocrine control.
Rather, these are local, self-regulatory mechanisms that allow each region of tissue to adjust its blood flow‚Äîand thus its perfusion.
These local mechanisms include chemical signals and myogenic controls.
Chemical Signals Involved in Autoregulation Chemical signals work at the level of the precapillary sphincters to trigger either constriction or relaxation.
As you know, opening a precapillary sphincter allows blood to flow into that particular capillary, whereas constricting a precapillary sphincter temporarily shuts off blood flow to that region.
The factors involved in regulating the precapillary sphincters include the following: ‚Ä¢Opening of the sphincter is triggered in response to decreased oxygen concentrations; increased carbon dioxide concentrations; increasing levels of lactic acid or other byproducts of cellular metabolism; increasing concentrations of potassium ions or hydrogen ions (falling pH); inflammatory chemicals such as histamines; and increased body temperature.
These conditions in turn stimulate the release of NO, a powerful vasodilator, from endothelial cells (see Figure 20.17 ).
‚Ä¢Contraction of the precapillary sphincter is triggered by the opposite levels of the regulators, which prompt the releaseofendothelins,powerfulvasoconstrictingpeptidessecretedbyendothelialcells.Plateletsecretionsandcertain prostaglandins may also trigger constriction.
Again, these factors alter tissue perfusion via their effects on the precapillary sphincter mechanism, which regulates blood flow to capillaries.
Since the amount of blood is limited, not all capillaries can fill at once, so blood flow is allocated basedupontheneedsandmetabolicstateofthetissuesasreflectedintheseparameters.Bearinmind,however,thatdilation and constriction of the arterioles feeding the capillary beds is the primary control mechanism.
The Myogenic Response Themyogenic response is a reaction to the stretching of the smooth muscle in the walls of arterioles as changes in blood flow occur through the vessel.
This may be viewed as a largely protective function against dramatic fluctuations in blood pressure and blood flow to maintain homeostasis.
If perfusion of an organ is too low (ischemia), the tissue will experience lowlevelsofoxygen(hypoxia).Incontrast,excessiveperfusioncoulddamagetheorgan‚Äôssmallerandmorefragilevessels.
The myogenic response is a localized process that serves to stabilize blood flow in the capillary network that follows that arteriole.
Whenbloodflowislow,thevessel‚Äôssmoothmusclewillbeonlyminimallystretched.Inresponse,itrelaxes,allowing the vessel to dilate and thereby increase the movement of blood into the tissue.
When blood flow is too high, the smooth muscle will contract in response to the increased stretch, prompting vasoconstriction that reduces blood flow .
Figure 20.20 summarizes the effects of nervous, endocrine, and local controls on arterioles.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 867 Figure 20.20 Summary of Mechanisms Regulating Arteriole Smooth Muscle and Veins Effect of Exercise on Vascular Homeostasis The heart is a muscle and, like any muscle, it responds dramatically to exercise.
For a healthy young adult, cardiac output (heartrate√óstrokevolume)increasesinthenonathletefromapproximately5.0liters(5.25quarts)perminutetoamaximum of about 20 liters (21 quarts) per minute.
Accompanying this will be an increase in blood pressure from about 120/80 to 185/75.However,well-trainedaerobicathletescanincreasethesevaluessubstantially.Fortheseindividuals,cardiacoutput soars from approximately 5.3 liters (5.57 quarts) per minute resting to more than 30 liters (31.5 quarts) per minute during maximal exercise.
Along with this increase in cardiac output, blood pressure increases from 120/80 at rest to 200/90 at maximum values.
In addition to improved cardiac function, exercise increases the size and mass of the heart.
The average weight of the heart for the nonathlete is about 300 g, whereas in an athlete it will increase to 500 g. This increase in size generally makes the heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, increasing both stroke volume and cardiac output.
Tissue perfusion also increases as the body transitions from a resting state to light exercise and eventually to heavy exercise (see Figure 20.20).
These changes result in selective vasodilation in the skeletal muscles, heart, lungs, liver, and integument.
Simultaneously, vasoconstriction occurs in the vessels leading to the kidneys and most of the digestive and reproductive organs.
The flow of blood to the brain remains largely unchanged whether at rest or exercising, since the vessels in the brain largely do not respond to regulatory stimuli, in most cases, because they lack the appropriate receptors.868 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 As vasodilation occurs in selected vessels, resistance drops and more blood rushes into the organs they supply.
This bloodeventuallyreturnstothevenoussystem.Venousreturnisfurtherenhancedbyboththeskeletalmuscleandrespiratory pumps.
As blood returns to the heart more quickly, preload rises and the Frank-Starling principle tells us that contraction ofthecardiacmuscleintheatriaandventricleswillbemoreforceful.Eventually,eventhebest-trainedathleteswillfatigue and must undergo a period of rest following exercise.
Cardiac output and distribution of blood then return to normal.
Regular exercise promotes cardiovascular health in a variety of ways.
Because an athlete‚Äôs heart is larger than a nonathlete‚Äôs,strokevolumeincreases,sotheathleticheartcandeliverthesameamountofbloodasthenonathleticheartbut with a lower heart rate.
This increased efficiency allows the athlete to exercise for longer periods of time before muscles fatigue and places less stress on the heart.
Exercise also lowers overall cholesterol levels by removing from the circulation a complex form of cholesterol, triglycerides, and proteins known as low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are widely associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
Although there is no way to remove deposits of plaque from the wallsofarteriesotherthanspecializedsurgery,exercisedoespromotethehealthofvesselsbydecreasingtherateofplaque formation and reducing blood pressure, so the heart does not have to generate as much force to overcome resistance.
Generally as little as 30 minutes of noncontinuous exercise over the course of each day has beneficial effects and has been shown to lower the rate of heart attack by nearly 50 percent.
While it is always advisable to follow a healthy diet, stopsmoking,andloseweight,studieshaveclearlyshownthatfit,overweightpeoplemayactuallybehealthieroverallthan sedentary slender people.
Thus, the benefits of moderate exercise are undeniable.
Clinical Considerations in Vascular Homeostasis Anydisorderthataffectsbloodvolume,vasculartone,oranyotheraspectofvascularfunctioningislikelytoaffectvascular homeostasis as well.
That includes hypertension, hemorrhage, and shock.
Hypertension and Hypotension Chronically elevated blood pressure is known clinically as hypertension.
It is defined as chronic and persistent blood pressure measurements of 140/90 mm Hg or above.
Pressures between 120/80 and 140/90 mm Hg are defined as prehypertension.
About 68 million Americans currently suffer from hypertension.
Unfortunately, hypertension is typically a silent disorder; therefore, hypertensive patients may fail to recognize the seriousness of their condition and fail to follow theirtreatmentplan.Theresultisoftenaheartattackorstroke.Hypertensionmayalsoleadtoananeurism(ballooningofa blood vessel caused by a weakening of the wall), peripheral arterial disease (obstruction of vessels in peripheral regions of the body), chronic kidney disease, or heart failure.
Listen to this CDC podcast (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/CDCpodcast) to learn about hypertension, often described as a ‚Äúsilent killer.‚Äù What steps can you take to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke?
Hemorrhage Minor blood loss is managed by hemostasis and repair.
Hemorrhage is a loss of blood that cannot be controlled by hemostatic mechanisms.
Initially, the body responds to hemorrhage by initiating mechanisms aimed at increasing blood pressure and maintaining blood flow.
Ultimately, however, blood volume will need to be restored, either through physiological processes or through medical intervention.
In response to blood loss, stimuli from the baroreceptors trigger the cardiovascular centers to stimulate sympathetic responsestoincreasecardiacoutputandvasoconstriction.Thistypicallypromptstheheartratetoincreasetoabout180‚Äì200 contractions per minute, restoring cardiac output to normal levels.
Vasoconstriction of the arterioles increases vascular resistance,whereasconstrictionoftheveinsincreasesvenousreturntotheheart.Bothofthesestepswillhelpincreaseblood pressure.
Sympathetic stimulation also triggers the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which enhance both cardiac output and vasoconstriction.
If blood loss were less than 20 percent of total blood volume, these responses together would usually return blood pressure to normal and redirect the remaining blood to the tissues.
Additional endocrine involvement is necessary, however, to restore the lost blood volume.
The angiotensin-renin- aldosterone mechanism stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, which increases fluid consumption to help restoreCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 869 the lost blood.
More importantly, it increases renal reabsorption of sodium and water, reducing water loss in urine output.
The kidneys also increase the production of EPO, stimulating the formation of erythrocytes that not only deliver oxygen to the tissues but also increase overall blood volume.
Figure 20.21 summarizes the responses to loss of blood volume.
Figure 20.21 Homeostatic Responses to Loss of Blood Volume Circulatory Shock The loss of too much blood may lead to circulatory shock, a life-threatening condition in which the circulatory system is unable to maintain blood flow to adequately supply sufficient oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues to maintain cellular metabolism.Itshouldnotbeconfusedwithemotionalorpsychologicalshock.Typically,thepatientincirculatoryshockwill demonstrate an increased heart rate but decreased blood pressure, but there are cases in which blood pressure will remain normal.
Urine output will fall dramatically, and the patient may appear confused or lose consciousness.
Urine output less than 1 mL/kg body weight/hour is cause for concern.
Unfortunately, shock is an example of a positive-feedback loop that, if uncorrected, may lead to the death of the patient.
There are several recognized forms of shock: ‚Ä¢Hypovolemic shock in adults is typically caused by hemorrhage, although in children it may be caused by fluid losses related to severe vomiting or diarrhea.
Other causes for hypovolemic shock include extensive burns, exposure to some toxins, and excessive urine loss related to diabetes insipidus or ketoacidosis.
Typically, patients present with a rapid, almost tachycardic heart rate; a weak pulse often described as ‚Äúthread;‚Äù cool, clammy skin, particularly in the extremities, due to restricted peripheral blood flow; rapid, shallow breathing; hypothermia; thirst; and dry mouth.
Treatments generally involve providing intravenous fluids to restore the patient to normal function and various drugs such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine to raise blood pressure.
‚Ä¢Cardiogenic shock results from the inability of the heart to maintain cardiac output.
Most often, it results from a myocardial infarction (heart attack), but it may also be caused by arrhythmias, valve disorders, cardiomyopathies, cardiac failure, or simply insufficient flow of blood through the cardiac vessels.
Treatment involves repairing the damage to the heart or its vessels to resolve the underlying cause, rather than treating cardiogenic shock directly .
‚Ä¢Vascular shock occurs when arterioles lose their normal muscular tone and dilate dramatically.
It may arise from a varietyofcauses,andtreatmentsalmostalwaysinvolvefluidreplacementandmedications,calledinotropicorpressor agents, which restore tone to the muscles of the vessels.
In addition, eliminating or at least alleviating the underlying cause of the condition is required.
This might include antibiotics and antihistamines, or select steroids, which may aid in the repair of nerve damage.
A common cause is sepsis(or septicemia), also called ‚Äúblood poisoning,‚Äù which is a widespread bacterial infection that results in an organismal-level inflammatory response known as septic shock .
Neurogenicshock isaformofvascularshockthatoccurswithcranialorspinalinjuriesthatdamagethecardiovascular centers in the medulla oblongata or the nervous fibers originating from this region.
Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic response that causes the widespread release of histamines, triggering vasodilation throughout the body.
‚Ä¢Obstructive shock, as the name would suggest, occurs when a significant portion of the vascular system is blocked.
It is not always recognized as a distinct condition and may be grouped with cardiogenic shock, including pulmonary embolism and cardiac tamponade.
Treatments depend upon the underlying cause and, in addition to administering fluids intravenously, often include the administration of anticoagulants, removal of fluid from the pericardial cavity, or air from the thoracic cavity, and surgery as required.
The most common cause is a pulmonary embolism, a clot that lodges in the pulmonary vessels and interrupts blood flow.
Other causes include stenosis of the aortic valve; cardiac tamponade, in which excess fluid in the pericardial cavity interferes with the ability of the heart to fully relax and fill withblood(resultingindecreasedpreload);andapneumothorax,inwhichanexcessiveamountofairispresentinthe870 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 thoracic cavity, outside of the lungs, which interferes with venous return, pulmonary function, and delivery of oxygen to the tissues.
20.5|Circulatory Pathways By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the vessels through which blood travels within the pulmonary circuit, beginning from the right ventricle of the heart and ending at the left atrium ‚Ä¢Create a flow chart showing the major systemic arteries through which blood travels from the aorta and its major branches, to the most significant arteries feeding into the right and left upper and lower limbs ‚Ä¢Create a flow chart showing the major systemic veins through which blood travels from the feet to the right atrium of the heart Virtually every cell, tissue, organ, and system in the body is impacted by the circulatory system.
This includes the generalizedandmorespecializedfunctionsoftransportofmaterials,capillaryexchange,maintaininghealthbytransporting white blood cells and various immunoglobulins (antibodies), hemostasis, regulation of body temperature, and helping to maintain acid-base balance.
In addition to these shared functions, many systems enjoy a unique relationship with the circulatory system.
Figure 20.22 summarizes these relationships.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 871 Figure 20.22 Interaction of the Circulatory System with Other Body Systems As you learn about the vessels of the systemic and pulmonary circuits, notice that many arteries and veins share the same names, parallel one another throughout the body, and are very similar on the right and left sides of the body.
These pairs of vessels will be traced through only one side of the body.
Where differences occur in branching patterns or when vessels are singular, this will be indicated.
For example, you will find a pair of femoral arteries and a pair of femoral veins, with one vessel on each side of the body.
In contrast, some vessels closer to the midline of the body, such as the aorta,areunique.Moreover,somesuperficialveins,suchasthegreatsaphenousveininthefemoralregion,havenoarterial counterpart.
Another phenomenon that can make the study of vessels challenging is that names of vessels can change with location.Likeastreetthatchangesnameasitpassesthroughanintersection,anarteryorveincanchangenamesasitpasses an anatomical landmark.
For example, the left subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery as it passes through the body wallandintotheaxillaryregion,andthenbecomesthebrachialarteryasitflowsfromtheaxillaryregionintotheupperarm (or brachium).
You will also find examples of anastomoses where two blood vessels that previously branched reconnect.
Anastomoses are especially common in veins, where they help maintain blood flow even when one vessel is blocked or narrowed, although there are some important ones in the arteries supplying the brain.
As you read about circular pathways, notice that there is an occasional, very large artery referred to as a trunk, a term indicating that the vessel gives rise to several smaller arteries.
For example, the celiac trunk gives rise to the left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries.
As you study this section, imagine you are on a ‚ÄúVoyage of Discovery‚Äù similar to Lewis and Clark‚Äôs expedition in 1804‚Äì1806, which followed rivers and streams through unfamiliar territory, seeking a water route from the Atlantic to872 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 the Pacific Ocean.
You might envision being inside a miniature boat, exploring the various branches of the circulatory system.Thissimpleapproachhasproveneffectiveformanystudentsinmasteringthesemajorcirculatorypatterns.Another approach that works well for many students is to create simple line drawings similar to the ones provided, labeling each of the major vessels.
It is beyond the scope of this text to name every vessel in the body.
However, we will attempt to discuss the major pathways for blood and acquaint you with the major named arteries and veins in the body.
Also, please keep in mind that individual variations in circulation patterns are not uncommon.
Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/arts1) for a brief summary of the arteries.
Pulmonary Circulation Recall that blood returning from the systemic circuit enters the right atrium (Figure 20.23) via the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus, which drains the blood supply of the heart muscle.
These vessels will be described more fully later in this section.
This blood is relatively low in oxygen and relatively high in carbon dioxide, since much of the oxygen has been extracted for use by the tissues and the waste gas carbon dioxide was picked up to be transported to the lungs for elimination.
From the right atrium, blood moves into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs for gas exchange.
This system of vessels is referred to as the pulmonary circuit .
The single vessel exiting the right ventricle is the pulmonary trunk.
At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve, which prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle during ventricular diastole.
As the pulmonary trunk reaches the superior surface of the heart, it curves posteriorly and rapidly bifurcates (divides) into two branches, a left and a right pulmonary artery.
To prevent confusion between these vessels, it is important to refer to the vesselexitingtheheartasthepulmonarytrunk,ratherthanalsocallingitapulmonaryartery.Thepulmonaryarteriesinturn branch many times within the lung, forming a series of smaller arteries and arterioles that eventually lead to the pulmonary capillaries.
The pulmonary capillaries surround lung structures known as alveoli that are the sites of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.
Once gas exchange is completed, oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary capillaries into a series of pulmonary venules that eventually lead to a series of larger pulmonary veins.
Four pulmonary veins, two on the left and two on the right, return blood to the left atrium.
At this point, the pulmonary circuit is complete.
Table 20.4 defines the major arteries and veins of the pulmonary circuit discussed in the text.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 873 Figure20.23PulmonaryCircuit Blood exiting from the right ventricle flows into the pulmonary trunk, which bifurcates into the two pulmonary arteries.
These vessels branch to supply blood to the pulmonary capillaries, where gas exchange occurs within the lung alveoli.
Blood returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium.

The Aorta Theaortais the largest artery in the body (Figure 20.25).
It arises from the left ventricle and eventually descends to the abdominal region, where it bifurcates at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries.
The aorta consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta, which passes through the diaphragm and a landmark that divides into the superior thoracic and inferior abdominal components.
Arteries originating from the aorta ultimately distribute blood to virtually all tissues of the body.
At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve that prevents backflow of blood into the left ventricle while the heart is relaxing.
After exiting the heart, the ascending aortamoves in a superior direction for approximately 5 cm and ends at the sternal angle.
Following this ascent, it reverses direction, forming a graceful arc to the left, called the aortic arch .
The aortic arch descends toward the inferior portions of the body and ends at the level of the intervertebral disk between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae.
Beyond this point, thedescendingaorta continuesclosetothebodiesofthevertebraeandpassesthroughanopeninginthediaphragmknown as theaortic hiatus.
Superior to the diaphragm, the aorta is called the thoracic aorta, and inferior to the diaphragm, it is called the abdominal aorta.
The abdominal aorta terminates when it bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries at theCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 875 levelofthefourthlumbarvertebra.See Figure20.25 foranillustrationoftheascendingaorta,theaorticarch,andtheinitial segment of the descending aorta plus major branches; Table 20.5 summarizes the structures of the aorta.

These sinuses contain the aortic baroreceptorsandchemoreceptorscriticaltomaintaincardiacfunction.Theleftcoronaryarteryarisesfromtheleftposterior aortic sinus.
The right coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus.
Normally, the right posterior aortic sinus does not give rise to a vessel.876 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The coronary arteries encircle the heart, forming a ring-like structure that divides into the next level of branches that supplies blood to the heart tissues.
(Seek additional content for more detail on cardiac circulation.)
Aortic Arch Branches There are three major branches of the aortic arch: the brachiocephalic artery, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian (literally ‚Äúunder the clavicle‚Äù) artery.
As you would expect based upon proximity to the heart, each of these vessels is classified as an elastic artery.
Thebrachiocephalicarteryislocatedonlyontherightsideofthebody;thereisnocorrespondingarteryontheleft.The brachiocephalicarterybranchesintotherightsubclavianarteryandtherightcommoncarotidartery.Theleftsubclavianand leftcommoncarotidarteriesariseindependentlyfromtheaorticarchbutotherwisefollowasimilarpatternanddistribution to the corresponding arteries on the right side (see Figure 20.23 ).
Eachsubclavian artery supplies blood to the arms, chest, shoulders, back, and central nervous system.
It then gives rise to three major branches: the internal thoracic artery, the vertebral artery, and the thyrocervical artery.
The internal thoracicartery,ormammaryartery,suppliesbloodtothethymus,thepericardiumoftheheart,andtheanteriorchestwall.
Thevertebralartery passesthroughthevertebralforameninthecervicalvertebraeandthenthroughtheforamenmagnum into the cranial cavity to supply blood to the brain and spinal cord.
The paired vertebral arteries join together to form the large basilar artery at the base of the medulla oblongata.
This is an example of an anastomosis.
The subclavian artery also givesrisetothe thyrocervicalartery thatprovidesbloodtothethyroid,thecervicalregionoftheneck,andtheupperback and shoulder.
Thecommoncarotidartery dividesintointernalandexternalcarotidarteries.Therightcommoncarotidarteryarises fromthebrachiocephalicarteryandtheleftcommoncarotidarteryarisesdirectlyfromtheaorticarch.The externalcarotid arterysupplies blood to numerous structures within the face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and larynx.
These branches includethelingual,facial,occipital,maxillary,andsuperficialtemporalarteries.The internalcarotidartery initiallyforms an expansion known as the carotid sinus, containing the carotid baroreceptors and chemoreceptors.
Like their counterparts in the aortic sinuses, the information provided by these receptors is critical to maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (see Figure 20.23 ).
The internal carotid arteries along with the vertebral arteries are the two primary suppliers of blood to the human brain.
Given the central role and vital importance of the brain to life, it is critical that blood supply to this organ remains uninterrupted.
Recall that blood flow to the brain is remarkably constant, with approximately 20 percent of blood flow directed to this organ at any given time.
When blood flow is interrupted, even for just a few seconds, a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or mini-stroke, may occur, resulting in loss of consciousness or temporary loss of neurological function.
In some cases, the damage may be permanent.
Loss of blood flow for longer periods, typically between 3 and 4 minutes, will likely produce irreversible brain damage or a stroke, also called a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
The locations of the arteries in the brain not only provide blood flow to the brain tissue but also prevent interruption in the flow of blood.
Both the carotid and vertebral arteries branch once they enter the cranial cavity, and some of these branches form a structure known as the arterial circle (orcircle of Willis), an anastomosis that is remarkably like a traffic circle that sends off branches (in this case, arterial branches to the brain).
As a rule, branches to the anterior portion of the cerebrum are normally fed by the internal carotid arteries; the remainder of the brain receives blood flow from branches associated with the vertebral arteries.
The internal carotid artery continues through the carotid canal of the temporal bone and enters the base of the brain throughthecarotidforamenwhereitgivesrisetoseveralbranches(Figure20.26 andFigure20.27).Oneofthesebranches istheanteriorcerebralartery thatsuppliesbloodtothefrontallobeofthecerebrum.Anotherbranch,the middlecerebral artery, supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes, which are the most common sites of CVAs.
The ophthalmic artery, the third major branch, provides blood to the eyes.
The right and left anterior cerebral arteries join together to form an anastomosis called the anterior communicating artery.Theinitialsegmentsoftheanteriorcerebralarteriesandtheanteriorcommunicatingarteryformtheanteriorportion of the arterial circle.
The posterior portion of the arterial circle is formed by a left and a right posterior communicating arterythat branches from the posterior cerebral artery , which arises from the basilar artery.
It provides blood to the posteriorportionofthecerebrumandbrainstem.The basilarartery isananastomosisthatbeginsatthejunctionofthetwo vertebral arteries and sends branches to the cerebellum and brain stem.
It flows into the posterior cerebral arteries.
Table 20.6summarizes the aortic arch branches, including the major branches supplying the brain.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 877 Figure 20.26 Arteries Supplying the Head and Neck The common carotid artery gives rise to the external and internal carotid arteries.
The external carotid artery remains superficial and gives rise to many arteries of the head.
The internal carotid artery first forms the carotid sinus and then reaches the brain via the carotid canal and carotid foramen, emerging into the cranium via the foramen lacerum.
The vertebral artery branches from the subclavian artery and passes through the transverse foramen in the cervical vertebrae, entering the base of the skull at the vertebral foramen.
The subclavian artery continues toward the arm as the axillary artery .
Figure 20.27 Arteries Serving the Brain This inferior view shows the network of arteries serving the brain.
The structure is referred to as the arterial circle or circle of Willis.878 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Aortic Arch Branches and Brain Circulation Vessel Description Brachiocephalic arterySingle vessel located on the right side of the body; the first vessel branching from the aortic arch; gives rise to the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery; supplies blood to the head, neck, upper limb, and wall of the thoracic region Subclavian arteryThe right subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic artery while the left subclavian artery arises from the aortic arch; gives rise to the internal thoracic, vertebral, and thyrocervical arteries; supplies blood to the arms, chest, shoulders, back, and central nervous system Internal thoracic arteryAlso called the mammary artery; arises from the subclavian artery; supplies blood to the thymus, pericardium of the heart, and anterior chest wall Vertebral arteryArises from the subclavian artery and passes through the vertebral foramen through the foramen magnum to the brain; joins with the internal carotid artery to form the arterial circle; supplies blood to the brain and spinal cord Thyrocervical arteryArises from the subclavian artery; supplies blood to the thyroid, the cervical region, the upper back, and shoulder Common carotid arteryThe right common carotid artery arises from the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery arises from the aortic arch; each gives rise to the external and internal carotid arteries; supplies the respective sides of the head and neck External carotid arteryArises from the common carotid artery; supplies blood to numerous structures within the face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and larynx Internal carotid arteryArises from the common carotid artery and begins with the carotid sinus; goes through the carotid canal of the temporal bone to the base of the brain; combines with the branches of the vertebral artery, forming the arterial circle; supplies blood to the brain Arterial circle or circle of WillisAn anastomosis located at the base of the brain that ensures continual blood supply; formed from the branches of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries; supplies blood to the brain Anterior cerebral arteryArises from the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum Middle cerebral arteryAnother branch of the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes of the cerebrum Ophthalmic arteryBranch of the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the eyes Anterior communicating arteryAn anastomosis of the right and left internal carotid arteries; supplies blood to the brain Posterior communicating arteryBranches of the posterior cerebral artery that form part of the posterior portion of the arterial circle; supplies blood to the brain Posterior cerebral arteryBranch of the basilar artery that forms a portion of the posterior segment of the arterial circle of Willis; supplies blood to the posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem Basilar arteryFormed from the fusion of the two vertebral arteries; sends branches to the cerebellum, brain stem, and the posterior cerebral arteries; the main blood supply to the brain stem Table 20.6 Thoracic Aorta and Major Branches The thoracic aorta begins at the level of vertebra T5 and continues through to the diaphragm at the level of T12, initially traveling within the mediastinum to the left of the vertebral column.
As it passes through the thoracic region, the thoracic aorta gives rise to several branches, which are collectively referred to as visceral branches and parietal branches (Figure 20.28).
Those branches that supply blood primarily to visceral organs are known as the visceral branches and include the bronchial arteries, pericardial arteries, esophageal arteries, and the mediastinal arteries, each named after the tissues it supplies.
Each bronchial artery (typically two on the left and one on the right) supplies systemic blood to the lungsCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 879 and visceral pleura, in addition to the blood pumped to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary circuit.
The bronchial arteriesfollowthesamepathastherespiratorybranches,beginningwiththebronchiandendingwiththebronchioles.There is considerable, but not total, intermingling of the systemic and pulmonary blood at anastomoses in the smaller branches of the lungs.
This may sound incongruous‚Äîthat is, the mixing of systemic arterial blood high in oxygen with the pulmonary arterial blood lower in oxygen‚Äîbut the systemic vessels also deliver nutrients to the lung tissue just as they do elsewhere in the body.
The mixed blood drains into typical pulmonary veins, whereas the bronchial artery branches remain separate and drain into bronchial veins described later.
Each pericardial artery supplies blood to the pericardium, the esophageal arteryprovides blood to the esophagus, and the mediastinal artery provides blood to the mediastinum.
The remaining thoracic aorta branches are collectively referred to as parietal branches or somatic branches, and include the intercostal and superior phrenic arteries.
Each intercostal artery provides blood to the muscles of the thoracic cavity and vertebral column.
The superior phrenic artery provides blood to the superior surface of the diaphragm.
Table 20.7 lists the arteries of the thoracic region.
Figure 20.28 Arteries of the Thoracic and Abdominal Regions The thoracic aorta gives rise to the arteries of the visceral and parietal branches.

This vessel remains to the left of the vertebral column and is embedded in adipose tissue behind the peritoneal cavity.
It formally ends at approximately the level of vertebra L4, where it bifurcates to form the common iliac arteries.
Before this division, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several important branches.
A single celiac trunk (artery) emerges and divides into theleft gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach and esophagus, the splenic artery to supply blood to the spleen, and thecommon hepatic artery, which in turn gives rise to the hepatic artery proper to supply blood to the liver, the right gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach, the cystic artery to supply blood to the gall bladder, and several branches, one to supply blood to the duodenum and another to supply blood to the pancreas.
Two additional single vessels arise from the abdominal aorta.
These are the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries.
The superior mesenteric artery arises approximately 2.5 cm after the celiac trunk and branches into several major vessels that supply blood to the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the pancreas, and a majority of the large intestine.
The inferior mesenteric arterysuppliesbloodtothedistalsegmentofthelargeintestine,includingtherectum.Itarisesapproximately5cmsuperior to the common iliac arteries.
In addition to these single branches, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several significant paired arteries along the way.
These include the inferior phrenic arteries, the adrenal arteries, the renal arteries, the gonadal arteries, and the lumbar arteries.
Each inferior phrenic artery is a counterpart of a superior phrenic artery and supplies blood to the inferior surfaceofthediaphragm.The adrenalartery suppliesbloodtotheadrenal(suprarenal)glandsandarisesnearthesuperior mesentericartery.Each renalartery branchesapproximately2.5cminferiortothesuperiormesentericarteriesandsupplies a kidney.
The right renal artery is longer than the left since the aorta lies to the left of the vertebral column and the vessel must travel a greater distance to reach its target.
Renal arteries branch repeatedly to supply blood to the kidneys.
Each gonadal artery supplies blood to the gonads, or reproductive organs, and is also described as either an ovarian artery or a testicular artery (internal spermatic), depending upon the sex of the individual.
An ovarian artery supplies blood to an ovary,uterine(Fallopian)tube,andtheuterus,andislocatedwithinthesuspensoryligamentoftheuterus.Itisconsiderably shorter than a testicular artery , which ultimately travels outside the body cavity to the testes, forming one component of the spermatic cord.
The gonadal arteries arise inferior to the renal arteries and are generally retroperitoneal.
The ovarian arterycontinuestotheuteruswhereitformsananastomosiswiththeuterinearterythatsuppliesbloodtotheuterus.Boththe uterine arteries and vaginal arteries, which distribute blood to the vagina, are branches of the internal iliac artery.
The four pairedlumbararteries arethecounterpartsoftheintercostalarteriesandsupplybloodtothelumbarregion,theabdominal wall, and the spinal cord.
In some instances, a fifth pair of lumbar arteries emer ges from the median sacral artery.

They split into external and internal iliac arteries approximately at the level of the lumbar- sacral articulation.
Each internal iliac artery sends branches to the urinary bladder, the walls of the pelvis, the external genitalia, and the medial portion of the femoral region.
In females, they also provide blood to the uterus and vagina.
The much larger external iliac artery supplies blood to each of the lower limbs.
Figure 20.29 shows the distribution of the major branches of the aorta into the thoracic and abdominal regions.
Figure 20.30 shows the distribution of the major branches of the common iliac arteries.

Although it does branch and supply blood to the region near the head of the humerus (via the humeral circumflex arteries), the majority of the vessel continues into the upper arm, or brachium, and becomes the brachial artery (Figure 20.31 ).
Thebrachial artery supplies blood to much of the brachial region and divides at the elbow into several smaller branches, including the deep brachial arteries, which provide blood to the posterior surface of the arm, and the ulnar collateral arteries, which supply bloodtotheregionoftheelbow.As thebrachialarteryapproachesthecoronoidfossa,itbifurcatesintotheradialandulnar arteries, which continue into the forearm, or antebrachium.

As it passes through the body wall, it is renamed the femoral artery.
It gives off several smaller branches as well as the lateral deep femoral artery that in turn gives rise to a lateral circumflex artery.
These arteries supply blood to the deep muscles of thethighaswellasventralandlateralregionsoftheintegument.Thefemoralarteryalsogivesrisetothe genicularartery, which provides blood to the region of the knee.
As the femoral artery passes posterior to the knee near the popliteal fossa, it is called the popliteal artery.
The popliteal artery branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.
Theanteriortibialartery islocatedbetweenthetibiaandfibula,andsuppliesbloodtothemusclesandintegumentof the anterior tibial region.
Upon reaching the tarsal region, it becomes the dorsalis pedis artery, which branches repeatedly and provides blood to the tarsal and dorsal regions of the foot.
The posterior tibial artery provides blood to the muscles andintegumentontheposteriorsurfaceofthetibialregion.Thefibularorperonealarterybranchesfromtheposteriortibial artery.
It bifurcates and becomes the medial plantar artery andlateral plantar artery , providing blood to the plantar surfaces.

Since the blood has already passed through the systemic capillaries, it will be relatively low in oxygen concentration.
In many cases, there will be veins draining organs and regions of the body with the same name as the arteries that supplied these regions and the two often parallel one another.
This is often described as a ‚Äúcomplementary‚Äù pattern.
However, there is a great deal more variability in the venous circulation than normally occurs in the arteries.
For the sake of brevity and clarity, this text will discuss only the most commonly encountered patterns.
However, keep this variation in mind when you move from the classroom to clinical practice.
In both the neck and limb regions, there are often both superficial and deeper levels of veins.
The deeper veins generallycorrespondtothecomplementaryarteries.Thesuperficialveinsdonotnormallyhavedirectarterialcounterparts, butinadditiontoreturningblood,theyalsomakecontributionstothemaintenanceofbodytemperature.Whentheambient temperature is warm, more blood is diverted to the superficial veins where heat can be more easily dissipated to the environment.
In colder weather, there is more constriction of the superficial veins and blood is diverted deeper where the body can retain more of the heat.

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/veinsum) for a brief online summary of the veins.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 889 Figure20.35MajorSystemicVeinsoftheBody The major systemic veins of the body are shown here in an anterior view.
The right atrium receives all of the systemic venous return.
Most of the blood flows into either the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava.
If you draw an imaginary line at the level of the diaphragm, systemic venous circulation from above thatlinewillgenerallyflowintothesuperiorvenacava;thisincludesbloodfromthehead,neck,chest,shoulders,andupper limbs.
The exception to this is that most venous blood flow from the coronary veins flows directly into the coronary sinus and from there directly into the right atrium.
Beneath the diaphragm, systemic venous flow enters the inferior vena cava, that is, blood from the abdominal and pelvic regions and the lower limbs.
The Superior Vena Cava Thesuperiorvenacava drainsmostofthebodysuperiortothediaphragm( Figure20.36).Onboththeleftandrightsides, thesubclavian vein forms when the axillary vein passes through the body wall from the axillary region.
It fuses with the external and internal jugular veins from the head and neck to form the brachiocephalic vein.
Each vertebral vein also flows into the brachiocephalic vein close to this fusion.
These veins arise from the base of the brain and the cervical region890 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 of the spinal cord, and flow largely through the intervertebral foramina in the cervical vertebrae.
They are the counterparts of the vertebral arteries.
Each internal thoracic vein , also known as an internal mammary vein, drains the anterior surface of the chest wall and flows into the brachiocephalic vein.
The remainder of the blood supply from the thorax drains into the azygos vein.
Each intercostal vein drains muscles of the thoracic wall, each esophageal vein delivers blood from the inferior portions of the esophagus, each bronchial vein drainsthesystemiccirculationfromthelungs,andseveralsmallerveinsdrainthemediastinalregion.Bronchialveinscarry approximately13percentofthebloodthatflowsintothebronchialarteries;theremainderintermingleswiththepulmonary circulation and returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins.
These veins flow into the azygos vein, and with the smaller hemiazygosvein (hemi-=‚Äúhalf‚Äù)ontheleftofthevertebralcolumn,drainbloodfromthethoracicregion.Thehemiazygos vein does not drain directly into the superior vena cava but enters the brachiocephalic vein via the superior intercostal vein.
The azygos vein passes through the diaphragm from the thoracic cavity on the right side of the vertebral column and begins in the lumbar region of the thoracic cavity.
It flows into the superior vena cava at approximately the level of T2, making a significant contribution to the flow of blood.
It combines with the two large left and right brachiocephalic veins to form the superior vena cava.
Table 20.11 summarizes the veins of the thoracic region that flow into the superior vena cava.
Figure 20.36 Veins of the Thoracic and Abdominal Regions Veins of the thoracic and abdominal regions drain blood from the area above the diaphragm, returning it to the right atrium via the superior vena cava.

Blood from the moresuperficialportionsofthehead,scalp,andcranialregions,includingthe temporalvein andmaxillaryvein,flowinto eachexternal jugular vein.
Although the external and internal jugular veins are separate vessels, there are anastomoses between them close to the thoracic region.
Blood from the external jugular vein empties into the subclavian vein.
Table 20.12summarizes the major veins of the head and neck.

Many smaller veins of the brain stem and the superficial veins of the cerebrum lead to larger vessels referred to as intracranial sinuses.
These include the superior and inferior sagittal sinuses, straight sinus, cavernous sinuses, left and right sinuses, the petrosal sinuses, and the occipital sinuses.
Ultimately, sinuses will lead back to either the inferior jugular vein or vertebral vein.
Most of the veins on the superior surface of the cerebrum flow into the largest of the sinuses, the superior sagittal sinus.
It is located midsagittally between the meningeal and periosteal layers of the dura mater within the falx cerebri and, at first glance in images or models, can be mistaken for the subarachnoid space.

From here, the veins come together to form the radial vein, the ulnar vein, and the median antebrachial vein.
The radial vein and the ulnar vein parallel the bones of the forearm and join together at the antebrachium to form the brachial vein, a deep vein that flows into the axillary vein in the brachium.
Themedian antebrachial vein parallels the ulnar vein, is more medial in location, and joins the basilic vein in the forearm.Asthebasilicveinreachestheantecubitalregion,itgivesoffabranchcalledthe mediancubitalvein thatcrosses atanangletojointhecephalicvein.Themediancubitalveinisthemostcommonsitefordrawingvenousbloodinhumans.
The basilic vein continues through the arm medially and superficially to the axillary vein.
Thecephalicvein beginsintheantebrachiumanddrainsbloodfromthesuperficialsurfaceofthearmintotheaxillary vein.
It is extremely superficial and easily seen along the surface of the biceps brachii muscle in individuals with good muscle tone and in those without excessive subcutaneous adipose tissue in the arms.
Thesubscapular vein drains blood from the subscapular region and joins the cephalic vein to form the axillary vein.
As it passes through the body wall and enters the thorax, the axillary vein becomes the subclavian vein.
Many of the larger veins of the thoracic and abdominal region and upper limb are further represented in the flow chart inFigure 20.39 .Table 20.14 summarizes the veins of the upper limbs.894 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 20.38 Veins of the Upper Limb This anterior view shows the veins that drain the upper limb.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 895 Figure 20.39 Veins Flowing into the Superior Vena Cava The flow chart summarizes the distribution of the veins flowing into the superior vena cava.

Lying just beneath the parietal peritoneum in the abdominal cavity, the inferior vena cava parallels the abdominal aorta, where it can receive blood from abdominal veins.
The lumbar portions of the abdominal wall and spinal cord are drained by a series of lumbar veins,usuallyfouroneachside.Theascendinglumbarveinsdrainintoeithertheazygosveinontherightorthehemiazygos vein on the left, and return to the superior vena cava.
The remaining lumbar veins drain directly into the inferior vena cava.
Blood supply from the kidneys flows into each renal vein, normally the largest veins entering the inferior vena cava.
A number of other, smaller veins empty into the left renal vein.
Each adrenal vein drains the adrenal or suprarenal glands located immediately superior to the kidneys.
The right adrenal vein enters the inferior vena cava directly, whereas the left adrenal vein enters the left renal vein.
From the male reproductive organs, each testicular vein flows from the scrotum, forming a portion of the spermatic cord.
Each ovarian vein drains an ovary in females.
Each of these veins is generically called a gonadal vein.
The right gonadal vein empties directly into the inferior vena cava, and the left gonadal vein empties into the left renal vein.
Each side of the diaphragm drains into a phrenic vein; the right phrenic vein empties directly into the inferior vena cava, whereas the left phrenic vein empties into the left renal vein.
Blood supply from the liver drains into each hepatic veinand directly into the inferior vena cava.
Since the inferior vena cava lies primarily to the right of the vertebral column and aorta, the left renal vein is longer, as are the left phrenic, adrenal, and gonadal veins.
The longer length of the left renal vein makes the left kidney the primary target of surgeons removing this organ for donation.
Figure 20.40 provides a flow chart of the veins flowing into the inferior vena cava.
Table 20.15 summarizes the major veins of the abdominal region.CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 897 Figure20.40VenousFlowintoInferiorVenaCava The flow chart summarizes veins that deliver blood to the inferior vena cava.

From the dorsal venous arch, blood supply drains into the anterior and posterior tibial veins.
The anterior tibial vein drains the area near the tibialis anterior muscle and combines with the posterior tibial vein and the fibular vein to form the popliteal vein.
The posterior tibial vein drains the posterior surface of the tibia and joins the popliteal vein.
The fibular vein drains the muscles and integument in proximity to the fibula and also joins the popliteal vein.
The small saphenous vein located on the lateral surface of the leg drains blood from the superficial regions of the lowerlegandfoot,andflowsintotothe poplitealvein.Asthepoplitealveinpassesbehindthekneeinthepoplitealregion, it becomes the femoral vein.

Asthefemoralvein penetratesthebodywallfromthefemoralportionoftheupperlimb,itbecomesthe externaliliac vein, a large vein that drains blood from the leg to the common iliac vein.
The pelvic organs and integument drain into the internal iliac vein, which forms from several smaller veins in the region, including the umbilical veins that run on either side of the bladder.
The external and internal iliac veins combine near the inferior portion of the sacroiliac joint to form the common iliac vein.
In addition to blood supply from the external and internal iliac veins, the middle sacral vein drains the sacralregionintothe commoniliacvein.Similartothecommoniliacarteries,thecommoniliacveinscometogetheratthe level of L5 to form the inferior vena cava.

It packages nutrients absorbed by the digestive system; produces plasmaproteins,clottingfactors,andbile;anddisposesofworn-outcellcomponentsandwasteproducts.Insteadofentering the circulation directly, absorbed nutrients and certain wastes (for example, materials produced by the spleen) travel to the liver for processing.
They do so via the hepatic portal system (Figure 20.43).
Portal systems begin and end in capillaries.
In this case, the initial capillaries from the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and spleen lead to the hepatic portal vein and end in specialized capillaries within the liver, the hepatic sinusoids.
You saw the only other portal system with the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal vessel in the endocrine chapter.
The hepatic portal system consists of the hepatic portal vein and the veins that drain into it.
The hepatic portal vein itselfisrelativelyshort,beginningatthelevelofL2withtheconfluenceofthesuperiormesentericandsplenicveins.Italso receives branches from the inferior mesenteric vein, plus the splenic veins and all their tributaries.
The superior mesenteric veinreceivesbloodfromthesmallintestine,two-thirdsofthelargeintestine,andthestomach.Theinferiormesentericvein drains the distal third of the large intestine, including the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum.
The splenic veinisformedfrombranchesfromthespleen,pancreas,andportionsofthestomach,andtheinferiormesentericvein.After its formation, the hepatic portal vein also receives branches from the gastric veins of the stomach and cystic veins from the gall bladder.
The hepatic portal vein delivers materials from these digestive and circulatory organs directly to the liver for processing.
Because of the hepatic portal system, the liver receives its blood supply from two different sources: from normal systemic circulation via the hepatic artery and from the hepatic portal vein.
The liver processes the blood from the portal system to remove certain wastes and excess nutrients, which are stored for later use.
This processed blood, as well as the systemic blood that came from the hepatic artery, exits the liver via the right, left, and middle hepatic veins, and flows into the inferior vena cava.
Overall systemic blood composition remains relatively stable, since the liver is able to metabolize the absorbed digestive components.902 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 20.43 Hepatic Portal System The liver receives blood from the normal systemic circulation via the hepatic artery.
It also receives and processes blood from other organs, delivered via the veins of the hepatic portal system.
All blood exits the liver via the hepatic vein, which delivers the blood to the inferior vena cava.
(Different colors are used to help distinguish among the different vessels in the system.)
20.6|Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the development of blood vessels ‚Ä¢Describe the fetal circulation In a developing embryo,the heart has developed enough by day 21 post-fertilization to begin beating.
Circulation patterns are clearly established by the fourth week of embryonic life.
It is critical to the survival of the developing human that the circulatory system forms early to supply the growing tissue with nutrients and gases, and to remove waste products.
Bloodcellsandvesselproductioninstructuresoutsidetheembryopropercalledtheyolksac,chorion,andconnectingstalk beginabout15to16daysfollowingfertilization.Developmentofthesecirculatoryelementswithintheembryoitselfbegins approximately 2 days later.
You will learn more about the formation and function of these early structures when you study thechapterondevelopment.Duringthosefirstfewweeks,bloodvesselsbegintoformfromtheembryonicmesoderm.The precursor cells are known as hemangioblasts.
These in turn differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood vessels and pluripotent stem cells, which differentiate into the formed elements of blood.
(Seek additional content for more detailonfetaldevelopmentandcirculation.
)Together,thesecellsformmassesknownas bloodislands scatteredthroughout the embryonic disc.
Spaces appear on the blood islands that develop into vessel lumens.
The endothelial lining of the vessels arise from the angioblasts within these islands.
Surrounding mesenchymal cells give rise to the smooth muscle and connectivetissuelayersofthevessels.Whilethevesselsaredeveloping,thepluripotentstemcellsbegintoformtheblood.
Vascular tubes also develop on the blood islands, and they eventually connect to one another as well as to the developing, tubular heart.
Thus, the developmental pattern, rather than beginning from the formation of one central vessel and spreading outward, occurs in many regions simultaneously with vessels later joining together.
This angiogenesis‚Äîthe creation of new blood vessels from existing ones‚Äîcontinues as needed throughout life as we grow and develop.
Blood vessel development often follows the same pattern as nerve development and travels to the same target tissues and organs.
This occurs because the many factors directing growth of nerves also stimulate blood vessels to follow a similarpattern.Whetheragivenvesseldevelopsintoanarteryoraveinisdependentuponlocalconcentrationsofsignaling proteins.
As the embryo grows within the mother‚Äôs uterus, its requirements for nutrients and gas exchange also grow.
The placenta‚Äîa circulatory organ unique to pregnancy‚Äîdevelops jointly from the embryo and uterine wall structures to fill this need.
Emerging from the placenta is the umbilical vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the mother to the fetal inferior vena cava via the ductus venosus to the heart that pumps it into fetal circulation.
Two umbilical arteries carry oxygen-depleted fetal blood, including wastes and carbon dioxide, to the placenta.
Remnants of the umbilical arteries remain in the adult.
(Seek additional content for more information on the role of the placenta in fetal circulation.
)CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 903 There are three major shunts‚Äîalternate paths for blood flow‚Äîfound in the circulatory system of the fetus.
Two of these shunts divert blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circuit, whereas the third connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava.
The first two shunts are critical during fetal life, when the lungs are compressed, filled with amniotic fluid, and nonfunctional, and gas exchange is provided by the placenta.
These shunts close shortly after birth, however, when the newborn begins to breathe.
The third shunt persists a bit longer but becomes nonfunctional once the umbilical cord is severed.
The three shunts are as follows ( Figure 20.44 ): ‚Ä¢Theforamen ovale is an opening in the interatrial septum that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium.Avalveassociatedwiththisopeningpreventsbackflowofbloodduringthefetalperiod.Asthenewbornbegins tobreatheandbloodpressureintheatriaincreases,thisshuntcloses.Thefossaovalisremainsintheinteratrialseptum after birth, marking the location of the former foramen ovale.
‚Ä¢Theductus arteriosus is a short, muscular vessel that connects the pulmonary trunk to the aorta.
Most of the blood pumpedfromtherightventricleintothepulmonarytrunkistherebydivertedintotheaorta.Onlyenoughbloodreaches the fetal lungs to maintain the developing lung tissue.
When the newborn takes the first breath, pressure within the lungs drops dramatically, and both the lungs and the pulmonary vessels expand.
As the amount of oxygen increases, the smooth muscles in the wall of the ductus arteriosus constrict, sealing off the passage.
Eventually, the muscular and endothelial components of the ductus arteriosus degenerate, leaving only the connective tissue component of the ligamentum arteriosum.
‚Ä¢Theductus venosus is a temporary blood vessel that branches from the umbilical vein, allowing much of the freshly oxygenated blood from the placenta‚Äîthe organ of gas exchange between the mother and fetus‚Äîto bypass the fetal liver and go directly to the fetal heart.
The ductus venosus closes slowly during the first weeks of infancy and degenerates to become the ligamentum venosum.
Figure 20.44 Fetal Shunts The foramen ovale in the interatrial septum allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium.
The ductus arteriosus is a temporary vessel, connecting the aorta to the pulmonary trunk.
The ductus venosus links the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava largely through the liver .904 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 abdominal aorta adrenal artery adrenal vein anaphylactic shock angioblasts angiogenesis anterior cerebral artery anterior communicating artery anterior tibial artery anterior tibial vein aorta aortic arch aortic hiatus aortic sinuses arterial circle arteriole arteriovenous anastomosis artery ascending aorta atrial reflex axillary artery axillary vein azygos veinKEY TERMS portion of the aorta inferior to the aortic hiatus and superior to the common iliac arteries branch of the abdominal aorta;

Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, formingCHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 913 arterioles.
Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues.
Capillaries lead back to small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart.
The arterialsystem is a relativelyhigh-pressure system, so arterieshave thick walls that appear round in cross section.
The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and thinner walls.
They often appear flattened.
Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica media,andtunicaexterna.Capillarieshaveonlyatunicaintimalayer.Thetunicaintimaisathinlayercomposedofasimple squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue.
The tunica media is a thicker area composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue.
It is the thickest layer in all but the largest arteries.
The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains some smooth muscle.
Blood flow through vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls.
20.2 Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance Blood flow is the movement of blood through a vessel, tissue, or organ.
The slowing or blocking of blood flow is called resistance.
Blood pressure is the force that blood exerts upon the walls of the blood vessels or chambers of the heart.
The components of blood pressure include systolic pressure, which results from ventricular contraction, and diastolic pressure, which results from ventricular relaxation.
Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic measures, and mean arterial pressure is the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù pressure of blood in the arterial system, driving blood into the tissues.
Pulse, the expansion and recoiling of an artery, reflects the heartbeat.
The variables affecting blood flow and blood pressure in the systemic circulation are cardiac output, compliance, blood volume, blood viscosity, and the length and diameter of the blood vessels.
In the arterial system, vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the arterioles is a significant factor in systemic blood pressure: Slight vasodilation greatly decreases resistance and increases flow, whereas slight vasoconstriction greatly increases resistance and decreases flow.
In the arterial system, as resistance increases, blood pressure increases and flow decreases.
In the venous system, constrictionincreases blood pressure as it does in arteries;the increasingpressure helps to return blood to the heart.
In addition, constriction causes the vessel lumen to become more rounded, decreasing resistance and increasing blood flow.
Venoconstriction, while less important than arterial vasoconstriction, works with the skeletal muscle pump, the respiratory pump, and their valves to promote venous return to the heart.
20.3 Capillary Exchange Small molecules can cross into and out of capillaries via simple or facilitated diffusion.
Some large molecules can cross in vesicles or through clefts, fenestrations, or gaps between cells in capillary walls.
However, the bulk flow of capillary and tissue fluid occurs via filtration and reabsorption.
Filtration, the movement of fluid out of the capillaries, is driven by the CHP.
Reabsorption, the influx of tissue fluid into the capillaries, is driven by the BCOP.
Filtration predominates in the arterialendofthecapillary;inthemiddlesection,theopposingpressuresarevirtuallyidenticalsothereisnonetexchange, whereas reabsorption predominates at the venule end of the capillary.
The hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures in the interstitial fluid are negligible in healthy circumstances.
20.4 Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System Neural, endocrine, and autoregulatory mechanisms affect blood flow, blood pressure, and eventually perfusion of blood to body tissues.
Neural mechanisms include the cardiovascular centers in the medulla oblongata, baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid arteries and right atrium, and associated chemoreceptors that monitor blood levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions.
Endocrine controls include epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as ADH, the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone mechanism, ANH, and EPO.
Autoregulation is the local control of vasodilation and constriction by chemical signalsandthemyogenicresponse.Exercisegreatlyimprovescardiovascularfunctionandreducestheriskofcardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, a leading cause of heart attacks and strokes.
Significant hemorrhage can lead to a form of circulatory shock known as hypovolemic shock.
Sepsis, obstruction, and widespread inflammation can also cause circulatory shock.
20.5 Circulatory Pathways The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries, which carryittotherightandleftlungsforgasexchange.Oxygen-richbloodistransportedbypulmonaryveinstotheleftatrium.
The left ventricle pumps this blood into the aorta.
The main regions of the aorta are the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta, which is further divided into the thoracic and abdominal aorta.
The coronary arteries branch from the ascending aorta.
After oxygenating tissues in the capillaries, systemic blood is returned to the right atrium from the venoussystemviathesuperiorvenacava,whichdrainsmostoftheveinssuperiortothediaphragm,theinferiorvenacava, which drains most of the veins inferior to the diaphragm, and the coronary veins via the coronary sinus.
The hepatic portal system carries blood to the liver for processing before it enters circulation.
Review the figures provided in this section for circulation of blood through the blood vessels.914 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 20.6 Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation Blood vessels begin to form from the embryonic mesoderm.
The precursor hemangioblasts differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood vessels and pluripotent stem cells that differentiate into the formed elements of the blood.
Together, these cells form blood islands scattered throughout the embryo.
Extensions known as vascular tubes eventually connect the vascular network.
As the embryo grows within the mother‚Äôs womb, the placenta develops to supply blood rich in oxygen and nutrients via the umbilical vein and to remove wastes in oxygen-depleted blood via the umbilical arteries.
Three major shunts found in the fetus are the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, which divert blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circuit, and the ductus venosus, which carries freshly oxygenated blood high in nutrients to the fetal heart.

(credit b: C. Goldsmith) Introduction Chapter Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Identify the components and anatomy of the lymphatic systemCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 919 ‚Ä¢Discuss the role of the innate immune response against pathogens ‚Ä¢Describe the power of the adaptive immune response to cure disease ‚Ä¢Explain immunological deficiencies and over-reactions of the immune system ‚Ä¢Discuss the role of the immune response in transplantation and cancer ‚Ä¢Describe the interaction of the immune and lymphatic systems with other body systems In June 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in Atlanta, Georgia, published a report of an unusual clusteroffivepatientsinLosAngeles,California.Allfivewerediagnosedwithararepneumoniacausedbyafunguscalled Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ).
Why was this unusual?
Although commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals, this fungus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes disease in individuals with suppressed or underdeveloped immune systems.
The very young, whose immune systems have yet to mature, and the elderly, whose immune systems have declined with age, are particularly susceptible.
The five patients from LA, though, were between 29 and 36 years of age and should have been in the prime of their lives, immunologically speaking.
What could be going on?
A few days later, a cluster of eight cases was reported in New York City, also involving young patients, this time exhibiting a rare form of skin cancer known as Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma.
This cancer of the cells that line the blood and lymphatic vessels was previously observed as a relatively innocuous disease of the elderly.
The disease that doctors saw in 1981 was frighteningly more severe, with multiple, fast-growing lesions that spread to all parts of the body, including the trunk and face.
Could the immune systems of these young patients have been compromised in some way?
Indeed, when they were tested, they exhibited extremely low numbers of a specific type of white blood cell in their bloodstreams, indicating that they had somehow lost a major part of the immune system.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, turned out to be a new disease caused by the previously unknown human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Although nearly 100 percent fatal in those with active HIV infections in the early years, the development of anti-HIV drugs has transformed HIV infection into a chronic, manageable disease and not the certaindeathsentenceitoncewas.OnepositiveoutcomeresultingfromtheemergenceofHIVdiseasewasthatthepublic‚Äôs attention became focused as never before on the importance of having a functional and healthy immune system.
21.1|Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the structure and function of the lymphatic tissue (lymph fluid, vessels, ducts, and or gans) ‚Ä¢Describe the structure and function of the primary and secondary lymphatic or gans ‚Ä¢Discuss the cells of the immune system, how they function, and their relationship with the lymphatic system Theimmune system is the complex collection of cells and organs that destroys or neutralizes pathogens that would otherwise cause disease or death.
The lymphatic system, for most people, is associated with the immune system to such a degreethatthetwosystemsarevirtuallyindistinguishable.The lymphaticsystem isthesystemofvessels,cells,andorgans that carries excess fluids to the bloodstream and filters pathogens from the blood.
The swelling of lymph nodes during an infectionandthetransportoflymphocytesviathelymphaticvesselsarebuttwoexamplesofthemanyconnectionsbetween these critical organ systems.
Functions of the Lymphatic System Amajorfunctionofthelymphaticsystemistodrainbodyfluidsandreturnthemtothebloodstream.Bloodpressurecauses leakage of fluid from the capillaries, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space‚Äîthat is, spaces between individual cells in the tissues.
In humans, 20 liters of plasma is released into the interstitial space of the tissues each day due to capillary filtration.
Once this filtrate is out of the bloodstream and in the tissue spaces, it is referred to as interstitial fluid.
Of this, 17 liters is reabsorbed directly by the blood vessels.
But what happens to the remaining three liters?
This is where the lymphatic system comes into play.
It drains the excess fluid and empties it back into the bloodstream via a series of vessels, trunks, and ducts.
Lymphis the term used to describe interstitial fluid once it has entered the lymphatic system.
When the lymphatic system is damaged in some way, such as by being blocked by cancer cells or destroyed by injury, protein-rich interstitial fluid accumulates (sometimes ‚Äúbacks up‚Äù from the lymph vessels) in the tissue spaces.
This inappropriate accumulation of fluid referred to as lymphedema may lead to serious medical consequences.
As the vertebrate immune system evolved, the network of lymphatic vessels became convenient avenues for transporting the cells of the immune system.
Additionally, the transport of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins absorbed in the gut uses this system.
Cells of the immune system not only use lymphatic vessels to make their way from interstitial spaces back into the circulation, but they also use lymph nodes as major staging areas for the development of critical immune responses.
A lymph node is one of the small, bean-shaped organs located throughout the lymphatic system.920 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Visitthis website(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lymphsystem) foranoverviewofthelymphaticsystem.Whatarethe three main components of the lymphatic system?
Structure of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic vessels begin as open-ended capillaries, which feed into larger and larger lymphatic vessels, and eventually empty into the bloodstream by a series of ducts.
Along the way, the lymph travels through the lymph nodes, which are commonly found near the groin, armpits, neck, chest, and abdomen.
Humans have about 500‚Äì600 lymph nodes throughout the body (Figure 21.2 ).
Figure 21.2 Anatomy of the Lymphatic System Lymphatic vessels in the arms and legs convey lymph to the larger lymphatic vessels in the torso.
Amajordistinctionbetweenthelymphaticandcardiovascularsystemsinhumansisthatlymphisnotactivelypumped by the heart, but is forced through the vessels by the movements of the body, the contraction of skeletal muscles during body movements, and breathing.
One-way valves (semi-lunar valves) in lymphatic vessels keep the lymph moving towardCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 921 the heart.
Lymph flows from the lymphatic capillaries, through lymphatic vessels, and then is dumped into the circulatory system via the lymphatic ducts located at the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins in the neck.
Lymphatic Capillaries Lymphatic capillaries , also called the terminal lymphatics, are vessels where interstitial fluid enters the lymphatic system to become lymph fluid.
Located in almost every tissue in the body, these vessels are interlaced among the arterioles and venulesofthecirculatorysysteminthesoftconnectivetissuesofthebody(Figure21.3).Exceptionsarethecentralnervous system, bone marrow, bones, teeth, and the cornea of the eye, which do not contain lymph vessels.
Figure 21.3 Lymphatic Capillaries Lymphatic capillaries are interlaced with the arterioles and venules of the cardiovascular system.
Collagen fibers anchor a lymphatic capillary in the tissue (inset).
Interstitial fluid slips through spaces between the overlapping endothelial cells that compose the lymphatic capillary .
Lymphatic capillaries are formed by a one cell-thick layer of endothelial cells and represent the open end of the system, allowing interstitial fluid to flow into them via overlapping cells (see Figure 21.3).
When interstitial pressure is low, the endothelial flaps close to prevent ‚Äúbackflow.‚Äù As interstitial pressure increases, the spaces between the cells open up,allowingthefluidtoenter.Entryoffluidintolymphaticcapillariesisalsoenabledbythecollagenfilamentsthatanchor the capillaries to surrounding structures.
As interstitial pressure increases, the filaments pull on the endothelial cell flaps, opening up them even further to allow easy entry of fluid.
Inthesmallintestine,lymphaticcapillariescalledlactealsarecriticalforthetransportofdietarylipidsandlipid-soluble vitamins to the bloodstream.
In the small intestine, dietary triglycerides combine with other lipids and proteins, and enter thelactealstoformamilkyfluidcalled chyle.Thechylethentravelsthroughthelymphaticsystem,eventuallyenteringthe liver and then the bloodstream.
Larger Lymphatic Vessels, Trunks, and Ducts The lymphatic capillaries empty into larger lymphatic vessels, which are similar to veins in terms of their three-tunic structure and the presence of valves.
These one-way valves are located fairly close to one another, and each one causes a bulge in the lymphatic vessel, giving the vessels a beaded appearance (see Figure 21.3 ).
The superficial and deep lymphatics eventually merge to form larger lymphatic vessels known as lymphatic trunks.
On the right side of the body, the right sides of the head, thorax, and right upper limb drain lymph fluid into the right subclavian vein via the right lymphatic duct ( Figure 21.4).
On the left side of the body, the remaining portions of the body drainintothelargerthoracicduct,whichdrainsintotheleftsubclavianvein.Thethoracicductitselfbeginsjustbeneaththe diaphragm in the cisterna chyli, a sac-like chamber that receives lymph from the lower abdomen, pelvis, and lower limbs by way of the left and right lumbar trunks and the intestinal trunk.922 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 21.4 Major Trunks and Ducts of the Lymphatic System The thoracic duct drains a much larger portion of the body than does the right lymphatic duct.

The Organization of Immune Function The immune system is a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble proteins that interact and communicate with each other in extraordinarilycomplexways.Themodernmodelofimmunefunctionisorganizedintothreephasesbasedonthetimingof their effects.
The three temporal phases consist of the following: ‚Ä¢Barrier defenses such as the skin and mucous membranes, which act instantaneously to prevent pathogenic invasion into the body tissues ‚Ä¢Therapidbutnonspecific innateimmuneresponse ,whichconsistsofavarietyofspecializedcellsandsolublefactors ‚Ä¢The slower but more specific and effective adaptive immune response, which involves many cell types and soluble factors, but is primarily controlled by white blood cells (leukocytes) known as lymphocytes, which help control immune responses The cells of the blood, including all those involved in the immune response, arise in the bone marrow via various differentiationpathwaysfromhematopoieticstemcells(Figure21.5).Incontrastwithembryonicstemcells,hematopoietic stem cells are present throughout adulthood and allow for the continuous differentiation of blood cells to replace those lost to age or function.
These cells can be divided into three classes based on function: ‚Ä¢Phagocytic cells, which ingest pathogens to destroy them ‚Ä¢Lymphocytes, which specifically coordinate the activities of adaptive immunity ‚Ä¢Cells containing cytoplasmic granules, which help mediate immune responses against parasites and intracellular pathogens such as virusesCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 923 Figure21.5HematopoieticSystemoftheBoneMarrow All the cells of the immune response as well as of the blood arise by differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells.
Platelets are cell fragments involved in the clotting of blood.
Lymphocytes: B Cells, T Cells, Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells As stated above, lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses ( Table 21.1 ).
The two basic types of lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm.Theyaredistinguishedfromeachotherbytheirsurfaceproteinmarkersaswellasbythemoleculestheysecrete.

The human body contains approximately 1012lymphocytes.
B Cells B cellsare immune cells that function primarily by producing antibodies.
An antibody is any of the group of proteins that binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecules known as antigens.
An antigenis a chemical structure on the surface of a pathogen that binds to T or B lymphocyte antigen receptors.
Once activated by binding to antigen, B cells differentiate into cells that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies.
These activated B cells are known as plasma cells.
T Cells TheTcell,ontheotherhand,doesnotsecreteantibodybutperformsavarietyoffunctionsintheadaptiveimmuneresponse.
Different T cell types have the ability to either secrete soluble factors that communicate with other cells of the adaptive immune response or destroy cells infected with intracellular pathogens.
The roles of T and B lymphocytes in the adaptive immune response will be discussed further in this chapter.
Plasma Cells Another type of lymphocyte of importance is the plasma cell.
A plasma cell is a B cell that has differentiated in response to antigen binding, and has thereby gained the ability to secrete soluble antibodies.
These cells differ in morphology from standard B and T cells in that they contain a large amount of cytoplasm packed with the protein-synthesizing machinery known as rough endoplasmic reticulum.924 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Natural Killer Cells A fourth important lymphocyte is the natural killer cell, a participant in the innate immune response.
A natural killer cell (NK) is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm.
It shares this mechanismwiththecytotoxicTcellsoftheadaptiveimmuneresponse.NKcellsareamongthebody‚Äôsfirstlinesofdefense against viruses and certain types of cancer.

What is the role of the dendritic cell in an HIV infection?
Primary Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocyte Development Understanding the differentiation and development of B and T cells is critical to the understanding of the adaptive immune response.
It is through this process that the body (ideally) learns to destroy only pathogens and leaves the body‚Äôs own cells relatively intact.
The primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus gland.
The lymphoid organs are where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack pathogens without harming the cells of the body.
Bone Marrow In the embryo, blood cells are made in the yolk sac.
As development proceeds, this function is taken over by the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver.
Later, the bone marrow takes over most hematopoietic functions, although the final stages of the differentiation of some cells may take place in other organs.
The red bone marrow is a loose collection of cells where hematopoiesis occurs, and the yellow bone marrow is a site of energy storage, which consists largely of fat cells (Figure 21.6).
The B cell undergoes nearly all of its development in the red bone marrow, whereas the immature T cell, called a thymocyte, leaves the bone marrow and matures largely in the thymus gland.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 925 Figure 21.6 Bone Marrow Red bone marrow fills the head of the femur, and a spot of yellow bone marrow is visible in the center.
The white reference bar is 1 cm.
Thymus Thethymusgland is a bilobed organ found in the space between the sternum and the aorta of the heart (Figure 21.7).
Connective tissue holds the lobes closely together but also separates them and forms a capsule.
Figure 21.7 Location, Structure, and Histology of the Thymus The thymus lies above the heart.
The trabeculae and lobules, including the darkly staining cortex and the lighter staining medulla of each lobule, are clearly visible in the light micrograph of the thymus of a newborn.

The cortex is densely packed so it stains more intensely than the rest of the thymus (see Figure 21.7).
The medulla, where thymocytes migrate before leaving the thymus, contains a less dense collection of thymocytes, epithelial cells, and dendritic cells.
Immune System Bytheyear2050,25percentofthepopulationoftheUnitedStateswillbe60yearsofageorolder.TheCDCestimates that80percentofthose60yearsandolderhaveoneormorechronicdiseaseassociatedwithdeficienciesoftheimmune systems.Thislossofimmunefunctionwithageiscalledimmunosenescence.Totreatthisgrowingpopulation,medical professionalsmustbetterunderstandtheagingprocess.Onemajorcauseofage-relatedimmunedeficienciesisthymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35‚Äì45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one‚Äôs life.Atthatpace,thetotallossofthymicepithelialtissueandthymocyteswouldoccuratabout120yearsofage.Thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan.
Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland.
Animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed.
There is evidence that the thymic microenvironment,sovitaltothedevelopmentofna√ØveTcells,losesthymicepithelialcellsaccordingtothedecreasing expression of the FOXN1 gene with age.
It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels.
Sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases.
What does all this tell us?
Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down?
The potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of na√Øve T cells high.
Gene therapies that target geneexpressionarealsoseenasfuturepossibilities.Themorewelearnthroughimmunosenescenceresearch,themore opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop.

Secondary Lymphoid Organs and their Roles in Active Immune Responses Lymphocytes develop and mature in the primary lymphoid organs, but they mount immune responses from the secondary lymphoid organs.
A na√Øve lymphocyte is one that has left the primary organ and entered a secondary lymphoid organ.
Na√Øve lymphocytes are fully functional immunologically, but have yet to encounter an antigen to respond to.
In addition to circulating in the blood and lymph, lymphocytes concentrate in secondary lymphoid organs, which include the lymph nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules.
All of these tissues have many features in common, including the following: ‚Ä¢The presence of lymphoid follicles, the sites of the formation of lymphocytes, with specific B cell-richand T cell-rich areasCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 927 ‚Ä¢An internal structure of reticular fibers with associated fixed macrophages ‚Ä¢Germinal centers, which are the sites of rapidly dividing B lymphocytes and plasma cells, with the exception of the spleen ‚Ä¢Specialized post-capillary vessels known as high endothelial venules; the cells lining these venules are thicker and more columnar than normal endothelial cells, which allow cells from the blood to directly enter these tissues Lymph Nodes Lymph nodes function to remove debris and pathogens from the lymph, and are thus sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúfilters of the lymph‚Äù (Figure 21.8).
Any bacteria that infect the interstitial fluid are taken up by the lymphatic capillaries and transported to a regional lymph node.
Dendritic cells and macrophages within this organ internalize and kill many of the pathogens that pass through, thereby removing them from the body.
The lymph node is also the site of adaptive immune responses mediated by T cells, B cells, and accessory cells of the adaptive immune system.
Like the thymus, the bean- shaped lymph nodes are surrounded by a tough capsule of connective tissue and are separated into compartments by trabeculae, the extensions of the capsule.
In addition to the structure provided by the capsule and trabeculae, the structural support of the lymph node is provided by a series of reticular fibers laid down by fibroblasts.
Figure 21.8 Structure and Histology of a Lymph Node Lymph nodes are masses of lymphatic tissue located along the larger lymph vessels.
The micrograph of the lymph nodes shows a germinal center, which consists of rapidly dividing B cells surrounded by a layer of T cells and other accessory cells.

Figure 21.9 Spleen (a) The spleen is attached to the stomach.
(b) A micrograph of spleen tissue shows the germinal center.
The marginal zone is the region between the red pulp and white pulp, which sequesters particulate antigens from the circulation and presents these antigens to lymphocytes in the white pulp.
(Micrograph provided by the Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) The spleen is also divided by trabeculae of connective tissue, and within each splenic nodule is an area of red pulp, consisting of mostly red blood cells, and white pulp, which resembles the lymphoid follicles of the lymph nodes.

The white pulp surrounds a central arteriole and consists of germinal centers of dividing B cells surrounded by T cells and accessory cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells.
Thus, the red pulp primarily functions as a filtration system of the blood, using cells of the relatively nonspecific immune response, and white pulp is where adaptive T and B cell responses are mounted.

Tonsilsarelymphoidnoduleslocatedalongtheinnersurfaceofthepharynxandareimportantindevelopingimmunity to oral pathogens (Figure 21.10).
The tonsil located at the back of the throat, the pharyngeal tonsil, is sometimes referred to as the adenoid when swollen.
Such swelling is an indication of an active immune response to infection.
Histologically, tonsils do not contain a complete capsule, and the epithelial layer invaginates deeply into the interior of the tonsil to formCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 929 tonsillar crypts.

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) consists of an aggregate of lymphoid follicles directly associated with the mucous membrane epithelia.
MALT makes up dome-shaped structures found underlying the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, breast tissue, lungs, and eyes.
Peyer‚Äôs patches, a type of MALT in the small intestine, are especially importantforimmuneresponsesagainstingestedsubstances(Figure21.11).Peyer‚Äôspatchescontainspecializedendothelial cells called M (or microfold) cells that sample material from the intestinal lumen and transport it to nearby follicles so that adaptive immune responses to potential pathogens can be mounted.

(Micrograph provided by the Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School ¬© 2012) Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) consists of lymphoid follicular structures with an overlying epithelial layer found along the bifurcations of the bronchi, and between bronchi and arteries.
They also have the typically less- organized structure of other lymphoid nodules.
These tissues, in addition to the tonsils, are effective against inhaled pathogens.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 931 21.2|Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Describe the barrier defenses of the body ‚Ä¢Show how the innate immune response is important and how it helps guide and prepare the body for adaptive immune responses ‚Ä¢Describe various soluble factors that are part of the innate immune response ‚Ä¢Explain the steps of inflammation and how they lead to destruction of a pathogen ‚Ä¢Discuss early induced immune responses and their level of effectiveness The immune system can be divided into two overlapping mechanisms to destroy pathogens: the innate immune response, which is relatively rapid but nonspecific and thus not always effective, and the adaptive immune response, which is slower initsdevelopmentduringaninitialinfectionwithapathogen,butishighlyspecificandeffectiveatattackingawidevariety of pathogens (Figure 21.12 ).
Figure 21.12 Cooperation between Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses The innate immune system enhances adaptive immune responses so they can be more effective.
Any discussion of the innate immune response usually begins with the physical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body, destroy them after they enter, or flush them out before they can establish themselves in the hospitable environment of the body‚Äôs soft tissues.
Barrier defenses are part of the body‚Äôs most basic defense mechanisms.
The barrier defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect against a broad range of pathogens.
The different modes of barrier defenses are associated with the external surfaces of the body, where pathogens may try to enter ( Table 21.2 ).
The primary barrier to the entrance of microorganisms into the body is the skin.
Not only is the skin covered with a layer of dead, keratinized epithelium that is too dry for bacteria in which to grow, but as these cells are continuously sloughed off from the skin, they carry bacteria and other pathogens with them.
Additionally, sweat and other skin secretions may lower pH, contain toxic lipids, and physically wash microbes away .932 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Barrier Defenses Site Specific defense Protective aspect Skin Epidermal surface Keratinized cells of surface, Langerhans cells Skin (sweat/secretions)Sweat glands, sebaceous glandsLow pH, washing action Oral cavity Salivary glands Lysozyme Stomach Gastrointestinal tract Low pH Mucosal surfaces Mucosal epithelium Nonkeratinized epithelial cells Normal flora (nonpathogenic bacteria)Mucosal tissuesPrevent pathogens from growing on mucosal surfaces Table 21.2 Another barrier is the saliva in the mouth, which is rich in lysozyme‚Äîan enzyme that destroys bacteria by digesting their cell walls.
The acidic environment of the stomach, which is fatal to many pathogens, is also a barrier.
Additionally, the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, eyes, ears, and nose traps both microbes and debris, and facilitates their removal.

Cells of the Innate Immune Response Aphagocyteisacellthatisabletosurroundandengulfaparticleorcell,aprocesscalled phagocytosis.Thephagocytesof theimmunesystemengulfotherparticlesorcells,eithertocleananareaofdebris,oldcells,ortokillpathogenicorganisms such as bacteria.
The phagocytes are the body‚Äôs fast acting, first line of immunological defense against organisms that have breached barrier defenses and have entered the vulnerable tissues of the body .
Phagocytes: Macrophages and Neutrophils Many of the cells of the immune system have a phagocytic ability, at least at some point during their life cycles.
Phagocytosis is an important and effective mechanism of destroying pathogens during innate immune responses.
The phagocyte takes the organism inside itself as a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome and its digestive enzymes, effectively killing many pathogens.
On the other hand, some bacteria including Mycobacteria tuberculosis , the cause of tuberculosis, may be resistant to these enzymes and are therefore much more difficult to clear from the body.
Macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are the major phagocytes of the immune system.
Amacrophage isanirregularlyshapedphagocytethatisamoeboidinnatureandisthemostversatileofthephagocytes in the body.
Macrophages move through tissues and squeeze through capillary walls using pseudopodia.
They not only participate in innate immune responses but have also evolved to cooperate with lymphocytes as part of the adaptive immune response.
Macrophages exist in many tissues of the body, either freely roaming through connective tissues or fixed to reticular fibers within specific tissues such as lymph nodes.
When pathogens breach the body‚Äôs barrier defenses, macrophages are the first line of defense (Table 21.3).
They are called different names, depending on the tissue: Kupffer cells in the liver, histiocytes in connective tissue, and alveolar macrophages in the lungs.
Aneutrophil is a phagocytic cell that is attracted via chemotaxis from the bloodstream to infected tissues.
These sphericalcellsaregranulocytes.Agranulocytecontainscytoplasmicgranules,whichinturncontainavarietyofvasoactive mediators such as histamine.
In contrast, macrophages are agranulocytes.
An agranulocyte has few or no cytoplasmic granules.
Whereas macrophages act like sentries, always on guard against infection, neutrophils can be thought of as military reinforcements that are called into a battle to hasten the destruction of the enemy.
Although, usually thought of as the primary pathogen-killing cell of the inflammatory process of the innate immune response, new research has suggested that neutrophils play a role in the adaptive immune response as well, just as macrophages do.
Amonocyte is a circulating precursor cell that differentiates into either a macrophage or dendritic cell, which can be rapidly attracted to areas of infection by signal molecules of inflammation.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 933 Phagocytic Cells of the Innate Immune System Cell Cell type Primary location Function in the innate immune response Macrophage Agranulocyte Body cavities/organs Phagocytosis Neutrophil Granulocyte Blood Phagocytosis Monocyte Agranulocyte Blood Precursor of macrophage/dendritic cell Table 21.3 Natural Killer Cells NK cells are a type of lymphocyte that have the ability to induce apoptosis, that is, programmed cell death, in cells infected with intracellular pathogens such as obligate intracellular bacteria and viruses.
NK cells recognize these cells by mechanisms that are still not well understood, but that presumably involve their surface receptors.
NK cells can induce apoptosis, in which a cascade of events inside the cell causes its own death by either of two mechanisms: 1) NK cells are able to respond to chemical signals and express the fas ligand.
The fas ligand is a surface molecule that binds to the fas molecule on the surface of the infected cell, sending it apoptotic signals, thus killing the cell and the pathogen within it; or 2) The granules of the NK cells release perforins and granzymes.
A perforin is a protein that forms pores in the membranes of infected cells.
A granzyme is a protein-digesting enzyme that enters the cell via the perforin pores and triggers apoptosis intracellularly.
Both mechanisms are especially effective against virally infected cells.
If apoptosis is induced before the virus has the ability to synthesize and assemble all its components, no infectious virus will be released from the cell, thus preventing further infection.
Recognition of Pathogens Cells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of pathogen- specificmolecules,suchasbacterialcellwallcomponentsorbacterialflagellarproteins,usingpatternrecognitionreceptors.
Apatternrecognitionreceptor(PRR) isamembrane-boundreceptorthatrecognizescharacteristicfeaturesofapathogen and molecules released by stressed or damaged cells.
These receptors, which are thought to have evolved prior to the adaptive immune response, are present on the cell surface whether they are needed or not.
Their variety, however, is limited by two factors.
First, the fact that each receptor type must be encoded by a specific gene requires the cell to allocate most or all of its DNA to make receptors able to recognize all pathogens.
Secondly, the variety of receptors is limited by the finite surface area of the cell membrane.
Thus, the innate immune system must ‚Äúget by‚Äù using only a limited number of receptors that are active against as wide a variety ofpathogensaspossible.Thisstrategyisinstarkcontrasttotheapproachusedbytheadaptiveimmunesystem,whichuses large numbers of different receptors, each highly specific to a particular pathogen.
Should the cells of the innate immune system come into contact with a species of pathogen they recognize, the cell willbindtothepathogenandinitiatephagocytosis(orcellularapoptosisinthecaseofanintracellularpathogen)inaneffort to destroy the offending microbe.
Receptors vary somewhat according to cell type, but they usually include receptors for bacterial components and for complement, discussed below.
Soluble Mediators of the Innate Immune Response The previous discussions have alluded to chemical signals that can induce cells to change various physiological characteristics, such as the expression of a particular receptor.
These soluble factors are secreted during innate or early induced responses, and later during adaptive immune responses.
Cytokines and Chemokines Acytokine is signaling molecule that allows cells to communicate with each other over short distances.
Cytokines are secreted into the intercellular space, and the action of the cytokine induces the receiving cell to change its physiology.
A chemokine is a soluble chemical mediator similar to cytokines except that its function is to attract cells (chemotaxis) from longer distances.934 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chemotaxis) to learn about phagocyte chemotaxis.
Phagocyte chemotaxis is the movement of phagocytes according to the secretion of chemical messengers in the form of interleukins and other chemokines.
By what means does a phagocyte destroy a bacterium that it has ingested?
Early induced Proteins Earlyinducedproteinsarethosethatarenotconstitutivelypresentinthebody,butaremadeastheyareneededearlyduring the innate immune response.
Interferons are an example of early induced proteins.
Cells infected with viruses secrete interferons that travel to adjacent cells and induce them to make antiviral proteins.
Thus, even though the initial cell is sacrificed, the surrounding cells are protected.
Other early induced proteins specific for bacterial cell wall components are mannose-binding protein and C-reactive protein, made in the liver, which bind specifically to polysaccharide components of the bacterial cell wall.
Phagocytes such as macrophages have receptors for these proteins, and they are thus able to recognizethemastheyareboundtothebacteria.Thisbringsthephagocyteandbacteriumintocloseproximityandenhances the phagocytosis of the bacterium by the process known as opsonization.
Opsonization is the tagging of a pathogen for phagocytosis by the binding of an antibody or an antimicrobial protein.
Complement System Thecomplement system is a series of proteins constitutively found in the blood plasma.
As such, these proteins are not considered part of the early induced immune response, even though they share features with some of the antibacterial proteinsofthisclass.Madeintheliver,theyhaveavarietyoffunctionsintheinnateimmuneresponse,usingwhatisknown asthe‚Äúalternatepathway‚Äùofcomplementactivation.Additionally,complementfunctionsintheadaptiveimmuneresponse as well, in what is called the classical pathway.
The complement system consists of several proteins that enzymatically alter and fragment later proteins in a series, which is why it is termed cascade.
Once activated, the series of reactions is irreversible, and releases fragments that have the following actions: ‚Ä¢Bind to the cell membrane of the pathogen that activates it, labeling it for phagocytosis (opsonization) ‚Ä¢Diffuse away from the pathogen and act as chemotactic agents to attract phagocytic cells to the site of inflammation ‚Ä¢Form damaging pores in the plasma membrane of the pathogen Figure 21.13 shows the classical pathway, which requires antibodies of the adaptive immune response.
The alternate pathway does not require an antibody to become activated.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 935 Figure21.13ComplementCascadeandFunction The classical pathway, used during adaptive immune responses, occurs when C1 reacts with antibodies that have bound an antigen.
The splitting of the C3 protein is the common step to both pathways.
In the alternate pathway, C3 is activated spontaneouslyand,afterreactingwiththemoleculesfactorP,factorB,andfactorD,splitsapart.Thelargerfragment,C3b, binds to the surface of the pathogen and C3a, the smaller fragment, diffuses outward from the site of activation and attracts phagocytes to the site of infection.
Surface-bound C3b then activates the rest of the cascade, with the last five proteins, C5‚ÄìC9, forming the membrane-attack complex (MAC).
The MAC can kill certain pathogens by disrupting their osmotic balance.
The MAC is especially effective against a broad range of bacteria.
The classical pathway is similar, except the early stages of activation require the presence of antibody bound to antigen, and thus is dependent on the adaptive immune response.
The earlier fragments of the cascade also have important functions.
Phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils are attracted to an infection site by chemotactic attraction to smaller complement fragments.
Additionally, once they arrive, their receptors for surface-bound C3b opsonize the pathogen for phagocytosis and destruction.
Inflammatory Response Thehallmarkoftheinnateimmuneresponseis inflammation.Inflammationissomethingeveryonehasexperienced.Stuba toe,cutafinger,ordoanyactivitythatcausestissuedamageandinflammationwillresult,withitsfourcharacteristics:heat, redness, pain, and swelling (‚Äúloss of function‚Äù is sometimes mentioned as a fifth characteristic).

Inflammation is part of a very basic form of immune response.
The process not only brings fluid and cells into the site to destroy the pathogen and remove it and debris from the site, but also helps to isolate the site, limiting the spread of the pathogen.
Acute inflammation is a short-term inflammatory response to an insult to the body.
If the cause of the inflammationisnotresolved,however,itcanleadtochronicinflammation,whichisassociatedwithmajortissuedestruction andfibrosis.
Chronicinflammation isongoinginflammation.Itcanbecausedbyforeignbodies,persistentpathogens,and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
There are four important parts to the inflammatory response: ‚Ä¢Tissue Injury.
The released contents of injured cells stimulate the release of mast cell granules and their potent inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.
Histamine increases the diameter of local blood vessels (vasodilation), causing an increase in blood flow.
Histamine also increases the permeability of local capillaries, causing plasma to leak out and form interstitial fluid.
This causes the swelling associated with inflammation.
Additionally,injuredcells,phagocytes,andbasophilsaresourcesofinflammatorymediators,includingprostaglandins and leukotrienes.
Leukotrienes attract neutrophils from the blood by chemotaxis and increase vascular permeability.
Prostaglandins cause vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and are a major cause of the pain associated with inflammation.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen relieve pain by inhibiting prostaglandin production.
‚Ä¢Vasodilation.
Many inflammatory mediators such as histamine are vasodilators that increase the diameters of local capillaries.
This causes increased blood flow and is responsible for the heat and redness of inflamed tissue.
It allows greater access of the blood to the site of inflammation.
‚Ä¢Increased Vascular Permeability.
At the same time, inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the local vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the interstitial space, resulting in the swelling, or edema, associated with inflammation.
‚Ä¢Recruitment of Phagocytes.
Leukotrienes are particularly good at attracting neutrophils from the blood to the site of infection by chemotaxis.
Following an early neutrophil infiltrate stimulated by macrophage cytokines, more macrophages are recruited to clean up the debris left over at the site.
When local infections are severe, neutrophils are attractedtothesitesofinfectionsinlargenumbers,andastheyphagocytosethepathogensandsubsequentlydie,their accumulated cellular remains are visible as pus at the infection site.
Overall, inflammation is valuable for many reasons.
Not only are the pathogens killed and debris removed, but the increaseinvascularpermeabilityencouragestheentryofclottingfactors,thefirststeptowardswoundrepair.Inflammation also facilitates the transport of antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the adaptive immune response.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 937 21.3|The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Explain the advantages of the adaptive immune response over the innate immune response ‚Ä¢List the various characteristics of an antigen ‚Ä¢Describe the types of T cell antigen receptors ‚Ä¢Outline the steps of T cell development ‚Ä¢Describe the major T cell types and their functions Innate immune responses (and early induced responses) are in many cases ineffective at completely controlling pathogen growth.
However, they slow pathogen growth and allow time for the adaptive immune response to strengthen and either controloreliminatethepathogen.Theinnateimmunesystemalsosendssignalstothecellsoftheadaptiveimmunesystem, guiding them in how to attack the pathogen.
Thus, these are the two important arms of the immune response.
The Benefits of the Adaptive Immune Response The specificity of the adaptive immune response‚Äîits ability to specifically recognize and make a response against a wide variety of pathogens‚Äîis its great strength.
Antigens, the small chemical groups often associated with pathogens, are recognized by receptors on the surface of B and T lymphocytes.
The adaptive immune response to these antigens is so versatile that it can respond to nearly any pathogen.
This increase in specificity comes because the adaptive immune response has a unique way to develop as many as 1011, or 100 trillion, different receptors to recognize nearly every conceivablepathogen.Howcouldsomanydifferenttypesofantibodiesbeencoded?Andwhataboutthemanyspecificities ofTcells?ThereisnotnearlyenoughDNAinacelltohaveaseparategeneforeachspecificity.Themechanismwasfinally worked out in the 1970s and 1980s using the new tools of molecular genetics Primary Disease and Immunological Memory The immune system‚Äôs first exposure to a pathogen is called a primary adaptive response.
Symptoms of a first infection, called primary disease, are always relatively severe because it takes time for an initial adaptive immune response to a pathogen to become effective.
Upon re-exposure to the same pathogen, a secondary adaptive immune response is generated, which is stronger and faster that the primary response.
The secondary adaptive response often eliminates a pathogen before it can cause significant tissue damage or any symptoms.
Without symptoms, there is no disease, and the individual is not even aware of the infection.
This secondary response is the basis of immunological memory, which protects us from getting diseases repeatedlyfromthesamepathogen.Bythismechanism,anindividual‚Äôsexposuretopathogensearlyinlifesparestheperson from these diseases later in life.
Self Recognition A third important feature of the adaptive immune response is its ability to distinguish between self-antigens, those that are normally present in the body, and foreign antigens, those that might be on a potential pathogen.
As T and B cells mature, there are mechanisms in place that prevent them from recognizing self-antigen, preventing a damaging immune response against the body.
These mechanisms are not 100 percent effective, however, and their breakdown leads to autoimmune diseases, which will be discussed later in this chapter.
T Cell-Mediated Immune Responses Theprimarycellsthatcontroltheadaptiveimmuneresponsearethelymphocytes,theTandBcells.Tcellsareparticularly important, as they not only control a multitude of immune responses directly, but also control B cell immune responses in manycasesaswell.Thus,manyofthedecisionsabouthowtoattackapathogenaremadeattheTcelllevel,andknowledge oftheirfunctionaltypesiscrucialtounderstandingthefunctioningandregulationofadaptiveimmuneresponsesasawhole.
T lymphocytes recognize antigens based on a two-chain protein receptor.
The most common and important of these are the alpha-beta T cell receptors ( Figure 21.15 ).938 CHAPTER 21 | THE L YMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 21.15 Alpha-beta T Cell Receptor Notice the constant and variable regions of each chain, anchored by the transmembrane region.
There are two chains in the T cell receptor, and each chain consists of two domains.
The variable region domain is furthest away from the T cell membrane and is so named because its amino acid sequence varies between receptors.
In contrast, the constant region domain has less variation.
The differences in the amino acid sequences of the variable domainsarethemolecularbasisofthediversityofantigensthereceptorcanrecognize.Thus,theantigen-bindingsiteofthe receptor consists of the terminal ends of both receptor chains, and the amino acid sequences of those two areas combine to determineitsantigenicspecificity.EachTcellproducesonlyonetypeofreceptorandthusisspecificforasingleparticular antigen.
Antigens Antigens on pathogens are usually large and complex, and consist of many antigenic determinants.
An antigenic determinant (epitope)isoneofthesmallregionswithinanantigentowhichareceptorcanbind,andantigenicdeterminants are limited by the size of the receptor itself.
They usually consist of six or fewer amino acid residues in a protein, or one or two sugar moieties in a carbohydrate antigen.
Antigenic determinants on a carbohydrate antigen are usually less diverse than on a protein antigen.
Carbohydrate antigens are found on bacterial cell walls and on red blood cells (the ABO blood group antigens).
Protein antigens are complex because of the variety of three-dimensional shapes that proteins can assume, andareespeciallyimportantfortheimmuneresponsestovirusesandwormparasites.Itistheinteractionoftheshapeofthe antigen and the complementary shape of the amino acids of the antigen-binding site that accounts for the chemical basis of specificity ( Figure 21.16 ).CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 939 Figure 21.16 Antigenic Determinants A typical protein antigen has multiple antigenic determinants, shown by the ability of T cells with three different specificities to bind to different parts of the same antigen.
Antigen Processing and Presentation Although Figure 21.16 shows T cell receptors interacting with antigenic determinants directly, the mechanism that T cells use to recognize antigens is, in reality, much more complex.
T cells do not recognize free-floating or cell-bound antigens as they appear on the surface of the pathogen.
They only recognize antigen on the surface of specialized cells called antigen-presenting cells.
Antigens are internalized by these cells.
Antigen processing is a mechanism that enzymatically cleaves the antigen into smaller pieces.
The antigen fragments are then brought to the cell‚Äôs surface and associated with a specializedtypeofantigen-presentingproteinknownasa majorhistocompatibilitycomplex(MHC) molecule.TheMHC is the cluster of genes that encode these antigen-presenting molecules.
The association of the antigen fragments with an MHC molecule on the surface of a cell is known as antigen presentation and results in the recognition of antigen by a T cell.
This association of antigen and MHC occurs inside the cell, and it is the complex of the two that is brought to the surface.
The peptide-binding cleft is a small indentation at the end of the MHC molecule that is furthest away from the cell membrane; it is here that the processed fragment of antigen sits.
MHC molecules are capable of presenting a variety of antigens,dependingontheaminoacidsequence,intheirpeptide-bindingclefts.ItisthecombinationoftheMHCmolecule andthefragmentoftheoriginalpeptideorcarbohydratethatisactuallyphysicallyrecognizedbytheTcellreceptor( Figure 21.17).940 CHAPTER 21 | THE L YMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 21.17 Antigen Processing and Presentation Two distinct types of MHC molecules, MHC class I andMHC class II, play roles in antigen presentation.
Although produced from different genes, they both have similar functions.
They bring processed antigen to the surface of the cell via a transport vesicle and present the antigen to the T cell and its receptor.
Antigens from different classes of pathogens, however, use different MHC classes and take different routes through the cell to get to the surface for presentation.
The basic mechanism, though, is the same.
Antigens are processed by digestion, are brought into the endomembrane system of thecell,andthenareexpressedonthesurfaceoftheantigen-presentingcellforantigenrecognitionbyaTcell.Intracellular antigens are typical of viruses, which replicate inside the cell, and certain other intracellular parasites and bacteria.
These antigens are processed in the cytosol by an enzyme complex known as the proteasome and are then brought into the endoplasmicreticulumby thetransporterassociatedwith antigenprocessing (TAP) system, where theyinteractwith class I MHC molecules and are eventually transported to the cell surface by a transport vesicle.
Extracellular antigens, characteristic of many bacteria, parasites, and fungi that do not replicate inside the cell‚Äôs cytoplasm, are brought into the endomembrane system of the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
The resulting vesicle fuses with vesicles from the Golgi complex, which contain pre-formed MHC class II molecules.
After fusion of these two vesicles and the association of antigen and MHC, the new vesicle makes its way to the cell surface.
Professional Antigen-presenting Cells Many cell types express class I molecules for the presentation of intracellular antigens.
These MHC molecules may then stimulate a cytotoxic T cell immune response, eventually destroying the cell and the pathogen within.
This is especially important when it comes to the most common class of intracellular pathogens, the virus.
Viruses infect nearly every tissue of the body, so all these tissues must necessarily be able to express class I MHC or no T cell response can be made.
Ontheotherhand,classIIMHCmoleculesareexpressedonlyonthecellsoftheimmunesystem,specificallycellsthat affectotherarmsoftheimmuneresponse.Thus,thesecellsarecalled‚Äúprofessional‚Äùantigen-presentingcellstodistinguish themfromthosethatbearclassIMHC.Thethreetypesofprofessionalantigenpresentersaremacrophages,dendriticcells, and B cells ( Table 21.4).
Macrophages stimulate T cells to release cytokines that enhance phagocytosis.
Dendritic cells also kill pathogens by phagocytosis (see Figure 21.17), but their major function is to bring antigens to regional draining lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes are the locations in which most T cell responses against pathogens of the interstitial tissues are mounted.
Macrophages are found in the skin and in the lining of mucosal surfaces, such as the nasopharynx, stomach, lungs, and intestines.
B cells may also present antigens to T cells, which are necessary for certain types of antibody responses, to be covered later in this chapter.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 941 Classes of Antigen-presenting Cells MHCCell typePhagocytic?

While thymocytes are in the cortex of the thymus, they are referred to as ‚Äúdouble negatives,‚Äù meaning that they do not bear the CD4 or CD8 molecules that you can use to follow their pathways of differentiation (Figure 21.18).
In the cortex of the thymus, they are exposed to cortical epithelial cells.
In a process known as positive selection , double-negative thymocytes bind to the MHC molecules they observe on the thymic epithelia, and the MHC molecules of ‚Äúself‚Äù are selected.
This mechanism kills many thymocytes during T cell differentiation.
In fact, only two percent of the thymocytes that enter the thymus leave it as mature, functional T cells.942 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure21.18 DifferentiationofTCellswithintheThymus Thymocytes enter the thymus and go through a series of developmental stages that ensures both function and tolerance before they leave and become functional components of the adaptive immune response.
Later, the cells become double positives that express both CD4 and CD8 markers and move from the cortex to the junction between the cortex and medulla.
It is here that negative selection takes place.
In negative selection, self-antigens are brought into the thymus from other parts of the body by professional antigen-presenting cells.
The T cells that bind to these self-antigens are selected for negatively and are killed by apoptosis.
In summary, the only T cells left are those that can bind to MHC molecules of the body with foreign antigens presented on their binding clefts, preventing an attack on one‚Äôs own body tissues, at least under normal circumstances.
Tolerance can be broken, however, by the development of an autoimmune response, to be discussed later in this chapter.
The cells that leave the thymus become single positives, expressing either CD4 or CD8, but not both (see Figure 21.18).
The CD4+T cells will bind to class II MHC and the CD8+cells will bind to class I MHC.
The discussion that follows explains the functions of these molecules and how they can be used to differentiate between the different T cell functional types.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 943 Mechanisms of T Cell-mediated Immune Responses Mature T cells become activated by recognizing processed foreign antigen in association with a self-MHC molecule and begin dividing rapidly by mitosis.
This proliferation of T cells is called clonal expansion and is necessary to make the immune response strong enough to effectively control a pathogen.
How does the body select only those T cells that are needed against a specific pathogen?
Again, the specificity of a T cell is based on the amino acid sequence and the three- dimensionalshapeoftheantigen-bindingsiteformedbythevariableregionsofthetwochainsoftheTcellreceptor(Figure 21.19).Clonal selection is the process of antigen binding only to those T cells that have receptors specific to that antigen.
Each T cell that is activated has a specific receptor ‚Äúhard-wired‚Äù into its DNA, and all of its progeny will have identical DNA and T cell receptors, forming clones of the original T cell.
Figure 21.19 Clonal Selection and Expansion of T Lymphocytes Stem cells differentiate into T cells with specific receptors, called clones.
The clones with receptors specific for antigens on the pathogen are selected for and expanded.
Clonal Selection and Expansion TheclonalselectiontheorywasproposedbyFrankBurnetinthe1950s.However,thetermclonalselectionisnotacomplete description of the theory, as clonal expansion goes hand in glove with the selection process.
The main tenet of the theory is that a typical individual has a multitude (1011) of different types of T cell clones based on their receptors.
In this use, a cloneis a group of lymphocytes that share the same antigen receptor.
Each clone is necessarily present in the body in low numbers.
Otherwise, the body would not have room for lymphocytes with so many specificities.
Only those clones of lymphocytes whose receptors are activated by the antigen are stimulated to proliferate.
Keep in mindthatmostantigenshavemultipleantigenicdeterminants,soaTcellresponsetoatypicalantigeninvolvesapolyclonal response.A polyclonalresponse isthestimulationofmultipleTcellclones.Onceactivated,theselectedclonesincreasein number and make many copies of each cell type, each clone with its unique receptor.
By the time this process is complete, the body will have large numbers of specific lymphocytes available to fight the infection (see Figure 21.19 ).
The Cellular Basis of Immunological Memory As already discussed, one of the major features of an adaptive immune response is the development of immunological memory.
Duringaprimaryadaptiveimmuneresponse,both memoryTcells andeffectorTcells aregenerated.MemoryTcells are long-lived and can even persist for a lifetime.
Memory cells are primed to act rapidly.
Thus, any subsequent exposure944 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 to the pathogen will elicit a very rapid T cell response.
This rapid, secondary adaptive response generates large numbers of effector T cells so fast that the pathogen is often overwhelmed before it can cause any symptoms of disease.
This is what is meant by immunity to a disease.
The same pattern of primary and secondary immune responses occurs in B cells and the antibody response, as will be discussed later in the chapter.
T Cell Types and their Functions In the discussion of T cell development, you saw that mature T cells express either the CD4 marker or the CD8 marker, but not both.
These markers are cell adhesion molecules that keep the T cell in close contact with the antigen-presenting cell by directly binding to the MHC molecule (to a different part of the molecule than does the antigen).
Thus, T cells and antigen-presentingcellsareheldtogetherintwoways:byCD4orCD8attachingtoMHCandbytheTcellreceptorbinding to antigen ( Figure 21.20 ).
Figure 21.20 Pathogen Presentation (a) CD4 is associated with helper and regulatory T cells.
An extracellular pathogen is processed and presented in the binding cleft of a class II MHC molecule, and this interaction is strengthened by the CD4 molecule.
(b) CD8 is associated with cytotoxic T cells.
An intracellular pathogen is presented by a class I MHC molecule, and CD8 interacts with it.
Althoughthecorrelationisnot100percent,CD4-bearingTcellsareassociatedwithhelperfunctionsandCD8-bearing Tcellsareassociatedwithcytotoxicity.ThesefunctionaldistinctionsbasedonCD4andCD8markersareusefulindefining the function of each type.
Helper T Cells and their Cytokines Helper T cells (Th), bearing the CD4 molecule, function by secreting cytokines that act to enhance other immune responses.
There are two classes of Th cells, and they act on different components of the immune response.
These cells are not distinguished by their surface molecules but by the characteristic set of cytokines they secrete ( Table 21.5).
Th1 cells are a type of helper T cell that secretes cytokines that regulate the immunological activity and development of a variety of cells, including macrophages and other types of T cells.
Th2 cells, on the other hand, are cytokine-secreting cells that act on B cells to drive their differentiation into plasma cellsthatmakeantibody.Infact,Tcellhelpisrequiredforantibodyresponsestomostproteinantigens,andthesearecalled T cell-dependent antigens.
Cytotoxic T cells Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) are T cells that kill target cells by inducing apoptosis using the same mechanism as NK cells.
They either express Fas ligand, which binds to the fas molecule on the target cell, or act by using perforins and granzymes contained in their cytoplasmic granules.
As was discussed earlier with NK cells, killing a virally infected cell before the virus can complete its replication cycle results in the production of no infectious particles.
As more Tc cells are developedCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 945 duringanimmuneresponse,theyoverwhelmtheabilityofthevirustocausedisease.Inaddition,eachTccellcankillmore than one target cell, making them especially effective.
Tc cells are so important in the antiviral immune response that some speculate that this was the main reason the adaptive immune response evolved in the first place.
Regulatory T Cells Regulatory T cells (Treg), or suppressor T cells, are the most recently discovered of the types listed here, so less is understood about them.
In addition to CD4, they bear the molecules CD25 and FOXP3.
Exactly how they function is still under investigation, but it is known that they suppress other T cell immune responses.
This is an important feature of the immune response, because if clonal expansion during immune responses were allowed to continue uncontrolled, these responses could lead to autoimmune diseases and other medical issues.
NotonlydoTcellsdirectlydestroypathogens,buttheyregulatenearlyallothertypesoftheadaptiveimmuneresponse as well, as evidenced by the functions of the T cell types, their surface markers, the cells they work on, and the types of pathogens they work against (see Table 21.5).

It was already known that individuals who survived a bacterial infection were immune to re-infection with the same pathogen.
Early microbiologists took serum from an immune patient and mixed it with a fresh culture of the same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a microscope.
The bacteria became clumped in a process called agglutination.
When a different bacterial species was used, the agglutination did not happen.
Thus, there was something in the serum of immune individuals that could specifically bind to and agglutinate bacteria.
Scientists now know the cause of the agglutination is an antibody molecule, also called an immunoglobulin.
What is an antibody?
An antibody protein is essentially a secreted form of a B cell receptor.
(In fact, surface immunoglobulin is another name for the B cell receptor.)
Not surprisingly, the same genes encode both the secreted antibodies and the surface immunoglobulins.Oneminordifferenceinthewaytheseproteinsaresynthesizeddistinguishesana√ØveBcellwithantibody on its surface from an antibody-secreting plasma cell with no antibodies on its surface.
The antibodies of the plasma cell have the exact same antigen-binding site and specificity as their B cell precursors.
There are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE.
Each of these has specific functions in the immune response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the great variety of antibody functions critical to many adaptive immune responses.
B cells do not recognize antigen in the complex fashion of T cells.
B cells can recognize native, unprocessed antigen and do not require the participation of MHC molecules and antigen-presenting cells.946 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 B Cell Differentiation and Activation B cells differentiate in the bone marrow.
During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells.
B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells.
Central tolerance isthedestructionorinactivationofBcellsthatrecognizeself-antigensinthebonemarrow,anditsroleiscritical and well established.
In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis, removing them from the population.
In the process of clonal anergy, however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function.
Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance.
In peripheral tolerance, functional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen.
Most protein antigens require signalsfromhelperTcells(Th2)toproceedtomakeantibody.WhenaBcellbindstoaself-antigenbutreceivesnosignals from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed.
This is yet another example of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response.
After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells.
Plasma cells often leave the secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole differentiation process started.
After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their energy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves.
Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally dif ferentiated.
The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell.
Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells.
They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when compared to the primary response, as illustrated below.
Antibody Structure Antibodies are glycoproteins consisting of two types of polypeptide chains with attached carbohydrates.
The heavy chain andthelightchain arethetwopolypeptidesthatformtheantibody.Themaindifferencesbetweentheclassesofantibodies are in the differences between their heavy chains, but as you shall see, the light chains have an important role, forming part of the antigen-binding site on the antibody molecules.
Four-chain Models of Antibody Structures All antibody molecules have two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.
(Some antibodies contain multiple units of this four-chain structure.)
The Fc region of the antibody is formed by the two heavy chains coming together, usually linked by disulfide bonds (Figure 21.21).
The Fc portion of the antibody is important in that many effector cells of the immune system have Fc receptors.
Cells having these receptors can then bind to antibody-coated pathogens, greatly increasing the specificity of the effector cells.
At the other end of the molecule are two identical antigen-binding sites.
Figure 21.21 Antibody and IgG2 Structures The typical four chain structure of a generic antibody (a) and the corresponding three-dimensional structure of the antibody IgG2 (b).
(credit b: modification of work by T im Vickers) Five Classes of Antibodies and their Functions Ingeneral,antibodieshavetwobasicfunctions.TheycanactastheBcellantigenreceptorortheycanbesecreted,circulate, and bind to a pathogen, often labeling it for identification by other forms of the immune response.
Of the five antibody classes, notice that only two can function as the antigen receptor for na√Øve B cells: IgM and IgD(Figure 21.22).
Mature B cells that leave the bone marrow express both IgM and IgD, but both antibodies have the same antigen specificity.
Only IgM is secreted, however, and no other nonreceptor function for IgD has been discovered.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 947 Figure 21.22 Five Classes of Antibodies IgMconsistsoffivefour-chainstructures(20totalchainswith10identicalantigen-bindingsites)andisthusthelargest oftheantibodymolecules.IgMisusuallythefirstantibodymadeduringaprimaryresponse.Its10antigen-bindingsitesand large shape allow it to bind well to many bacterial surfaces.
It is excellent at binding complement proteins and activating the complement cascade, consistent with its role in promoting chemotaxis, opsonization, and cell lysis.
Thus, it is a very effective antibody against bacteria at early stages of a primary antibody response.
As the primary response proceeds, the antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG, IgA, or IgE by the process known as class switching.
Class switching is the change of one antibody class to another.
While the class of antibody changes, the specificity and the antigen-binding sites do not.
Thus, the antibodies made are still specific to the pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response.
IgGis a major antibody of late primary responses and the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood.
This is because class switching occurs during primary responses.
IgG is a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens from the blood and can activate complement proteins (although not as well as IgM), taking advantage of its antibacterial activities.
Furthermore,thisclassofantibodyistheonethatcrossestheplacentatoprotectthedevelopingfetusfromdiseaseexitsthe blood to the interstitial fluid to fight extracellular pathogens.
IgAexists in two forms, a four-chain monomer in the blood and an eight-chain structure, or dimer, in exocrine gland secretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and tears.
Thus, dimeric IgA is the only antibody to leave the interior of the body to protect body surfaces.
IgA is also of importance to newborns, because this antibody is present in mother‚Äôs breast milk (colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.
IgEis usually associated with allergies and anaphylaxis.
It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood, because its Fc region binds strongly to an IgE-specific Fc receptor on the surfaces of mast cells.
IgE makes mast cell degranulation very specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be peanut-specific IgE bound to his or her mast cells.
In this person, eating peanuts will cause the mast cells to degranulate, sometimes causing severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, a severe, systemic allergic response that can cause death.
Clonal Selection of B Cells Clonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T cells.
Only B cells with appropriate antigen specificity are selected for and expanded (Figure 21.23 ).
Eventually, the plasma cells secrete antibodies with antigenic specificityidenticaltothosethatwereonthesurfacesoftheselectedBcells.Noticeinthefigurethatbothplasmacellsand memory B cells are generated simultaneously.948 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 21.23 Clonal Selection of B Cells During a primary B cell immune response, both antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells are produced.
These memory cells lead to the differentiation of more plasma cells and memory B cells during secondary responses.
Primary versus Secondary B Cell Responses Primary and secondary responses as they relate to T cells were discussed earlier.
This section will look at these responses with B cells and antibody production.
Because antibodies are easily obtained from blood samples, they are easy to follow and graph (Figure 21.24).
As you will see from the figure, the primary response to an antigen (representing a pathogen) is delayed by several days.
This is the time it takes for the B cell clones to expand and differentiate into plasma cells.
The level of antibody produced is low, but it is sufficient for immune protection.
The second time a person encounters the same antigen, there is no time delay, and the amount of antibody made is much higher.
Thus, the secondary antibody response overwhelms the pathogens quickly and, in most situations, no symptoms are felt.
When a different antigen is used, another primary response is made with its low antibody levels and time delay .CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 949 Figure 21.24 Primary and Secondary Antibody Responses Antigen A is given once to generate a primary response and later to generate a secondary response.
When a different antigen is given for the first time, a new primary response is made.
Active versus Passive Immunity Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can be acquired by (1) the active development of an immune response in the infected individual or (2) the passive transfer of immunecomponentsfromanimmuneindividualtoanonimmuneone.Bothactiveandpassiveimmunityhaveexamplesin the natural world and as part of medicine.
Active immunity is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual (Table 21.6 ).
Naturally acquired active immunity, the response to a pathogen, is the focus of this chapter.
Artificially acquired active immunity involves the use of vaccines.
A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its components that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of immunological memory (a weakened primary immuneresponse)withoutcausingmuchinthewayofsymptoms.Thus,withtheuseofvaccines,onecanavoidthedamage from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from immunological memory.
The advent of vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the eradication of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio, measles, and whooping cough.
Active versus Passive Immunity Natural Artificial Active Adaptive immune response Vaccine response Passive Trans-placental antibodies/breastfeeding Immune globulin injections Table 21.6 Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own active immune response.
Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development.
IgG is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its life.
As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during breastfeeding.Thefetusandnewbornthusbenefitfromtheimmunologicalmemoryofthemothertothepathogenstowhich she has been exposed.
In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen.
This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen.
The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lackofthedevelopmentofimmunologicalmemory.Oncetheantibodiesaretransferred,theyareeffectiveforonlyalimited time before they degrade.950 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Immunity can be acquired in an active or passive way, and it can be natural or artificial.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/immunity) to see an animated discussion of passive and active immunity.
What is an example of natural immunity acquired passively?
T cell-dependent versus T cell-independent Antigens As discussed previously, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that drive the production of antibodies in a B cell, responding to complex antigens such as those made by proteins.
On the other hand, some antigens are T cell independent.
A T cell- independent antigen usually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties found on the cell walls of bacteria.
Each antibody on the B cell surface has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent antigen leads to crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell.
The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the absence of T cell cytokines.
AT cell-dependent antigen , on the other hand, usually is not repeated to the same degree on the pathogen and thus does not crosslink surface antibody with the same efficiency.
To elicit a response to such antigens, the B and T cells must come close together (Figure 21.25).
The B cell must receive two signals to become activated.
Its surface immunoglobulin must recognize native antigen.
Some of this antigen is internalized, processed, and presented to the Th2 cells on a class II MHC molecule.
The T cell then binds using its antigen receptor and is activated to secrete cytokines that diffuse to the B cell, finally activating it completely.
Thus, the B cell receives signals from both its surface antibody and the T cell via its cytokines, and acts as a professional antigen-presenting cell in the process.
Figure 21.25 T and B Cell Binding To elicit a response to a T cell-dependent antigen, the B and T cells must come close together.
To become fully activated, the B cell must receive two signals from the native antigen and the T cell‚Äôs cytokines.
21.5|The Immune Response against Pathogens By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Explain the development of immunological competence ‚Ä¢Describe the mucosal immune response ‚Ä¢Discuss immune responses against bacterial, viral, fungal, and animal pathogens ‚Ä¢Describe different ways pathogens evade immune responses Nowthatyouunderstandthedevelopmentofmature,na√ØveBcellsandTcells,andsomeoftheirmajorfunctions,howdoall of these various cells, proteins, and cytokines come together to actually resolve an infection?
Ideally, the immune responseCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 951 will rid the body of a pathogen entirely.
The adaptive immune response, with its rapid clonal expansion, is well suited to this purpose.
Think of a primary infection as a race between the pathogen and the immune system.
The pathogen bypasses barrier defenses and starts multiplying in the host‚Äôs body.
During the first 4 to 5 days, the innate immune response will partially control, but not stop, pathogen growth.
As the adaptive immune response gears up, however, it will begin to clear the pathogen from the body, while at the same time becoming stronger and stronger.
When following antibody responses in patients with a particular disease such as a virus, this clearance is referred to as seroconversion (sero- = ‚Äúserum‚Äù).
Seroconversion is the reciprocal relationship between virus levels in the blood and antibody levels.
As the antibody levels rise,theviruslevelsdecline,andthisisasignthattheimmuneresponseisbeingatleastpartiallyeffective(partially,because in many diseases, seroconversion does not necessarily mean a patient is getting well).
An excellent example of this is seroconversion during HIV disease (Figure 21.26).
Notice that antibodies are made early in this disease, and the increase in anti-HIV antibodies correlates with a decrease in detectable virus in the blood.
Although these antibodies are an important marker for diagnosing the disease, they are not sufficient to completely clear the virus.
Several years later, the vast majority of these individuals, if untreated, will lose their entire adaptive immune response, including the ability to make antibodies, during the final stages of AIDS.
Figure 21.26 HIV Disease Progression Seroconversion, the rise of anti-HIV antibody levels and the concomitant decline in measurable virus levels, happens during the first several months of HIV disease.
Unfortunately, this antibody response is ineffective at controlling the disease, as seen by the progression of the disease towards AIDS, in which all adaptive immune responses are compromised.
Disinfectants: Fighting the Good Fight?
‚ÄúWash your hands!‚Äù Parents have been telling their children this for generations.
Dirty hands can spread disease.
But is it possible to get rid of enough pathogens that children will never get sick?
Are children who avoid exposure to pathogens better off?
The answers to both these questions appears to be no.
Antibacterial wipes, soaps, gels, and even toys with antibacterial substances embedded in their plastic are ubiquitous in our society.
Still, these products do not rid the skin and gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, and it would be harmful to our health if they did.
We need these nonpathogenic bacteria on and within our bodies to keep the pathogeniconesfromgrowing.Theurgetokeepchildrenperfectlycleanisthusprobablymisguided.Childrenwillget sick anyway, and the later benefits of immunological memory far outweigh the minor discomforts of most childhood diseases.
In fact, getting diseases such as chickenpox or measles later in life is much harder on the adult and are associated with symptoms significantly worse than those seen in the childhood illnesses.
Of course, vaccinations help children avoid some illnesses, but there are so many pathogens, we will never be immune to them all.
Could over-cleanliness be the reason that allergies are increasing in more developed countries?
Some scientists think so.
Allergies are based on an IgE antibody response.
Many scientists think the system evolved to help the body rid itself of worm parasites.
The hygiene theory is the idea that the immune system is geared to respond to antigens, and if pathogens are not present, it will respond instead to inappropriate antigens such as allergens and self-antigens.
Thisisoneexplanationfortherisingincidenceofallergiesindevelopedcountries,wheretheresponsetononpathogens like pollen, shrimp, and cat dander cause allergic responses while not serving any protective function.952 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 The Mucosal Immune Response Mucosal tissues are major barriers to the entry of pathogens into the body.
The IgA (and sometimes IgM) antibodies in mucus and other secretions can bind to the pathogen, and in the cases of many viruses and bacteria, neutralize them.
Neutralization is the process of coating a pathogen with antibodies, making it physically impossible for the pathogen to bind to receptors.
Neutralization, which occurs in the blood, lymph, and other body fluids and secretions, protects the body constantly.
Neutralizing antibodies are the basis for the disease protection offered by vaccines.
Vaccinations for diseases thatcommonlyenterthebodyviamucousmembranes,suchasinfluenza,areusuallyformulatedtoenhanceIgAproduction.
Immune responses in some mucosal tissues such as the Peyer‚Äôs patches (see Figure 21.11) in the small intestine take up particulate antigens by specialized cells known as microfold or M cells (Figure 21.27).
These cells allow the body to sample potential pathogens from the intestinal lumen.
Dendritic cells then take the antigen to the regional lymph nodes, where an immune response is mounted.
Figure 21.27 IgA Immunity The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and Peyer‚Äôs patches of the small intestine generate IgA immunity.
Both use M cells to transport antigen inside the body so that immune responses can be mounted.
Defenses against Bacteria and Fungi Thebodyfightsbacterialpathogenswithawidevarietyofimmunologicalmechanisms,essentiallytryingtofindonethatis effective.
Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae, the cause of leprosy, are resistant to lysosomal enzymes and can persist in macrophage organelles or escape into the cytosol.
In such situations, infected macrophages receiving cytokine signals from Th1 cells turn on special metabolic pathways.
Macrophage oxidative metabolism is hostile to intracellular bacteria, often relying on the production of nitric oxide to kill the bacteria inside the macrophage.
Fungalinfections,suchasthosefrom Aspergillus, Candida,and Pneumocystis,arelargelyopportunisticinfectionsthat take advantage of suppressed immune responses.
Most of the same immune mechanisms effective against bacteria have similar effects on fungi, both of which have characteristic cell wall structures that protect their cells.
Defenses against Parasites Worm parasites such as helminths are seen as the primary reason why the mucosal immune response, IgE-mediated allergy and asthma, and eosinophils evolved.
These parasites were at one time very common in human society.
When infecting a human,oftenviacontaminatedfood,somewormstakeupresidenceinthegastrointestinaltract.EosinophilsareattractedtoCHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 953 thesitebyTcellcytokines,whichreleasetheirgranulecontentsupontheirarrival.Mastcelldegranulationalsooccurs,and the fluid leakage caused by the increase in local vascular permeability is thought to have a flushing action on the parasite, expelling its larvae from the body.
Furthermore, if IgE labels the parasite, the eosinophils can bind to it by its Fc receptor.
Defenses against Viruses The primary mechanisms against viruses are NK cells, interferons, and cytotoxic T cells.
Antibodies are effective against viruses mostly during protection, where an immune individual can neutralize them based on a previous exposure.
Antibodies have no effect on viruses or other intracellular pathogens once they enter the cell, since antibodies are not able to penetrate the plasma membrane of the cell.
Many cells respond to viral infections by downregulating their expression of MHC class I molecules.
This is to the advantage of the virus, because without class I expression, cytotoxic T cells have no activity.
NK cells, however, can recognize virally infected class I-negative cells and destroy them.
Thus, NK and cytotoxic T cells have complementary activities against virally infected cells.
Interferons have activity in slowing viral replication and are used in the treatment of certain viral diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, but their ability to eliminate the virus completely is limited.
The cytotoxic T cell response, though, is key,asiteventuallyoverwhelmsthevirusandkillsinfectedcellsbeforetheviruscancompleteitsreplicativecycle.Clonal expansion and the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill more than one target cell make these cells especially effective against viruses.
In fact, without cytotoxic T cells, it is likely that humans would all die at some point from a viral infection (if no vaccine were available).
Evasion of the Immune System by Pathogens It is important to keep in mind that although the immune system has evolved to be able to control many pathogens, pathogens themselves have evolved ways to evade the immune response.
An example already mentioned is in Mycobactrium tuberculosis, which has evolved a complex cell wall that is resistant to the digestive enzymes of the macrophages that ingest them, and thus persists in the host, causing the chronic disease tuberculosis.
This section briefly summarizes other ways in which pathogens can ‚Äúoutwit‚Äù immune responses.
But keep in mind, although it seems as if pathogens have a will of their own, they do not.
All of these evasive ‚Äústrategies‚Äù arose strictly by evolution, driven by selection.
Bacteria sometimes evade immune responses because they exist in multiple strains, such as different groups of Staphylococcus aureus.
S. aureus is commonly found in minor skin infections, such as boils, and some healthy people harbor it in their nose.
One small group of strains of this bacterium, however, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, has become resistant to multiple antibiotics and is essentially untreatable.
Different bacterial strains differ in the antigens on their surfaces.
The immune response against one strain (antigen) does not affect the other; thus, the species survives.
Another method of immune evasion is mutation.
Because viruses‚Äô surface molecules mutate continuously, viruses like influenza change enough each year that the flu vaccine for one year may not protect against the flu common to the next.
New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season.
Genetic recombination‚Äîthe combining of gene segments from two different pathogens‚Äîis an efficient form of immune evasion.
For example, the influenza virus contains gene segments that can recombine when two different viruses infect the same cell.
Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
Pathogens can produce immunosuppressive molecules that impair immune function, and there are several different types.Virusesareespeciallygoodatevadingtheimmuneresponseinthisway,andmanytypesofviruseshavebeenshown to suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by HIV .
21.6|Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Discuss inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies ‚Ä¢Explain the four types of hypersensitivity and how they differ ‚Ä¢Give an example of how autoimmune disease breaks tolerance This section is about how the immune system goes wrong.
When it goes haywire, and becomes too weak or too strong, it leadstoastateofdisease.Thefactorsthatmaintainimmunologicalhomeostasisarecomplexandincompletelyunderstood.
Immunodeficiencies Asyouhaveseen,theimmunesystemisquitecomplex.Ithasmanypathwaysusingmanycelltypesandsignals.Becauseit is so complex, there are many ways for it to go wrong.
Inherited immunodeficiencies arise from gene mutations that affect954 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 specific components of the immune response.
There are also acquired immunodeficiencies with potentially devastating effects on the immune system, such as HIV.
Inherited Immunodeficiencies Alistofallinheritedimmunodeficienciesiswellbeyondthescopeofthisbook.Thelistisalmostaslongasthelistofcells, proteins, and signaling molecules of the immune system itself.
Some deficiencies, such as those for complement, cause only a higher susceptibility to some Gram-negative bacteria.
Others are more severe in their consequences.
Certainly, the most serious of the inherited immunodeficiencies is severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID).
This disease is complex because it is caused by many different genetic defects.
What groups them together is the fact that both the B cell and T cell arms of the adaptive immune response are affected.
Children with this disease usually die of opportunistic infections within their first year of life unless they receive a bone marrow transplant.
Such a procedure had not yet been perfected for David Vetter, the ‚Äúboy in the bubble,‚Äù who was treated for SCID by having to live almost his entire life in a sterile plastic cocoon for the 12 years before his death from infection in 1984.
One of the features that make bone marrow transplants work as well as they do is the proliferative capability of hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow.
Only a small amount of bone marrow from a healthy donor is given intravenously to the recipient.
It finds its own way to the bone where it populates it, eventually reconstituting the patient‚Äôs immune system, which is usually destroyed beforehand by treatment with radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs.
NewtreatmentsforSCIDusinggenetherapy,insertingnondefectivegenesintocellstakenfromthepatientandgiving them back, have the advantage of not needing the tissue match required for standard transplants.
Although not a standard treatment, this approach holds promise, especially for those in whom standard bone marrow transplantation has failed.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus/AIDS Althoughmanyvirusescausesuppressionoftheimmunesystem,onlyonewipesitoutcompletely,andthatisthepreviously mentioned HIV.
It is worth discussing the biology of this virus, which can lead to the well-known AIDS, so that its full effects on the immune system can be understood.
The virus is transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids, and blood, and canbecaughtbyriskysexualbehaviorsandthesharingofneedlesbyintravenousdrugusers.Therearesometimes,butnot always, flu-like symptoms in the first 1 to 2 weeks after infection.
This is later followed by seroconversion.
The anti-HIV antibodies formed during seroconversion are the basis for most initial HIV screening done in the United States.
Because seroconversiontakesdifferentlengthsoftimeindifferentindividuals,multipleAIDStestsaregivenmonthsaparttoconfirm or eliminate the possibility of infection.
After seroconversion, the amount of virus circulating in the blood drops and stays at a low level for several years.
During this time, the levels of CD4+cells, especially helper T cells, decline steadily, until at some point, the immune responseissoweakthatopportunisticdiseaseandeventuallydeathresult.CD4isthereceptorthatHIVusestogetinsideT cellsandreproduce.GiventhatCD4+helperTcellsplayanimportantroleinotherinTcellimmuneresponsesandantibody responses, it should be no surprise that both types of immune responses are eventually seriously compromised.
Treatment for the disease consists of drugs that target virally encoded proteins that are necessary for viral replication butareabsentfromnormalhumancells.Bytargetingthevirusitselfandsparingthecells,thisapproachhasbeensuccessful in significantly prolonging the lives of HIV-positive individuals.
On the other hand, an HIV vaccine has been 30 years in development and is still years away.
Because the virus mutates rapidly to evade the immune system, scientists have been looking for parts of the virus that do not change and thus would be good tar gets for a vaccine candidate.
Hypersensitivities The word ‚Äúhypersensitivity‚Äù simply means sensitive beyond normal levels of activation.
Allergies and inflammatory responses to nonpathogenic environmental substances have been observed since the dawn of history.
Hypersensitivity is a medicaltermdescribingsymptomsthatarenowknowntobecausedbyunrelatedmechanismsofimmunity.Still,itisuseful for this discussion to use the four types of hypersensitivities as a guide to understand these mechanisms ( Figure 21.28 ).CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 955 Figure 21.28 Immune Hypersensitivity Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivity.
Notice that types I‚ÄìIII are B cell mediated, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T cell phenomenon.
Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity Antigens that cause allergic responses are often referred to as allergens.
The specificity of the immediate hypersensitivity response is predicated on the binding of allergen-specific IgE to the mast cell surface.
The process of producing allergen- specific IgE is called sensitization, and is a necessary prerequisite for the symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity to occur.
Allergies and allergic asthma are mediated by mast cell degranulation that is caused by the crosslinking of the antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface.
The mediators released have various vasoactive effects already discussed, but the major symptoms of inhaled allergens are the nasal edema and runny nose caused by the increased vascular permeability and increased blood flow of nasal blood vessels.
As these mediators are released with mast cell degranulation, type I hypersensitivity reactions are usually rapid and occur within just a few minutes, hence the term immediate hypersensitivity.
Most allergens are in themselves nonpathogenic and therefore innocuous.
Some individuals develop mild allergies, which are usually treated with antihistamines.
Others develop severe allergies that may cause anaphylactic shock, which can potentially be fatal within 20 to 30 minutes if untreated.
This drop in blood pressure (shock) with accompanying contractions of bronchial smooth muscle is caused by systemic mast cell degranulation when an allergen is eaten (for example, shellfish and peanuts), injected (by a bee sting or being administered penicillin), or inhaled (asthma).
Because epinephrine raises blood pressure and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, it is routinely used to counteract the effects of anaphylaxis and can be lifesaving.
Patients with known severe allergies are encouraged to keep automatic epinephrine injectors with them at all times, especially when away from easy access to hospitals.
Allergists use skin testing to identify allergens in type I hypersensitivity.
In skin testing, allergen extracts are injected into the epidermis, and a positive result of a soft, pale swelling at the site surrounded by a red zone (called the wheal and flare response), caused by the release of histamine and the granule mediators, usually occurs within 30 minutes.
The soft center is due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels and the redness is caused by the increased blood flow to the area that results from the dilation of local blood vessels at the site.
Type II and Type III Hypersensitivities Type II hypersensitivity , which involves IgG-mediated lysis of cells by complement proteins, occurs during mismatched blood transfusions and blood compatibility diseases such as erythroblastosis fetalis (see section on transplantation).
Type III hypersensitivity occurs with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where soluble antigens, mostly DNA and othermaterialfromthenucleus,andantibodiesaccumulateinthebloodtothepointthattheantigenandantibodyprecipitate along blood vessel linings.
These immune complexes often lodge in the kidneys, joints, and other organs where they can activate complement proteins and cause inflammation.956 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Delayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity Delayed hypersensitivity, or type IV hypersensitivity, is basically a standard cellular immune response.
In delayed hypersensitivity, the first exposure to an antigen is called sensitization, such that on re-exposure, a secondary cellular response results, secreting cytokines that recruit macrophages and other phagocytes to the site.
These sensitized T cells, of theTh1class,willalsoactivatecytotoxicTcells.Thetimeittakesforthisreactiontooccuraccountsforthe24-to72-hour delay in development.
The classical test for delayed hypersensitivity is the tuberculin test for tuberculosis, where bacterial proteins from M. tuberculosis are injected into the skin.
A couple of days later, a positive test is indicated by a raised red area that is hard to thetouch,calledaninduration,whichisaconsequenceofthecellularinfiltrate,anaccumulationofactivatedmacrophages.
A positive tuberculin test means that the patient has been exposed to the bacteria and exhibits a cellular immune response to it.
Another type of delayed hypersensitivity is contact sensitivity, where substances such as the metal nickel cause a red and swollen area upon contact with the skin.
The individual must have been previously sensitized to the metal.
A much moreseverecaseofcontactsensitivityispoisonivy,butmanyoftheharshestsymptomsofthereactionareassociatedwith the toxicity of its oils and are not T cell mediated.
Autoimmune Responses The worst cases of the immune system over-reacting are autoimmune diseases.
Somehow, tolerance breaks down and the immunesystemsinindividualswiththesediseasesbegintoattacktheirownbodies,causingsignificantdamage.Thetrigger for these diseases is, more often than not, unknown, and the treatments are usually based on resolving the symptoms using immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids.
These diseases can be localized and crippling, as in rheumatoid arthritis, or diffuse in the body with multiple symptoms that differ in different individuals, as is the case with systemic lupus erythematosus ( Figure 21.29 ).
Figure 21.29 Autoimmune Disorders: Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus (a) Extensive damage to the right hand of a rheumatoid arthritis sufferer is shown in the x-ray.
(b) The diagram shows a variety of possible symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus.
Environmental triggers seem to play large roles in autoimmune responses.
One explanation for the breakdown of tolerance is that, after certain bacterial infections, an immune response to a component of the bacterium cross-reacts with a self-antigen.
This mechanism is seen in rheumatic fever, a result of infection with Streptococcus bacteria, which causes strep throat.
The antibodies to this pathogen‚Äôs M protein cross-react with an antigenic component of heart myosin, a major contractile protein of the heart that is critical to its normal function.
The antibody binds to these molecules and activates complementproteins, causing damageto the heart, especiallyto the heart valves.
On the other hand, some theories propose that having multiple common infectious diseases actually prevents autoimmune responses.
The fact that autoimmune diseases are rare in countries that have a high incidence of infectious diseases supports this idea, another example of the hygiene hypothesis discussed earlier in this chapter.
There are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well.
Some diseases are associated with the MHC genes that an individual expresses.
The reason for this association is likely because if one‚Äôs MHC molecules are not able to present a certain self-antigen, then that particular autoimmune disease cannot occur.
Overall, there are more than 80 different autoimmune diseases, which are a significant health problem in the elderly.
Table 21.7 lists several of the most common autoimmune diseases, the antigens that are targeted, and the segment of the adaptive immune response that causes the damage.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 957 Autoimmune Diseases Disease Autoantigen Symptoms Celiac disease Tissue transglutaminase Damage to small intestine Diabetes mellitus type IBeta cells of pancreasLow insulin production; inability to regulate serum glucose Graves‚Äô diseaseThyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (antibody blocks receptor)Hyperthyroidism Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditisThyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (antibody mimics hormone and stimulates receptor)Hypothyroidism Lupus erythematosusNuclear DNA and proteins Damage of many body systems Myasthenia gravisAcetylcholine receptor in neuromuscular junctions Debilitating muscle weakness Rheumatoid arthritisJoint capsule antigens Chronic inflammation of joints Table 21.7 21.7|Transplantation and Cancer Immunology By the end of this section, you will be able to: ‚Ä¢Explain why blood typing is important and what happens when mismatched blood is used in a transfusion ‚Ä¢Describe how tissue typing is done during organ transplantation and the role of transplant anti-rejection drugs ‚Ä¢Show how the immune response is able to control some cancers and how this immune response might be enhanced by cancer vaccines The immune responses to transplanted organs and to cancer cells are both important medical issues.
With the use of tissue typingandanti-rejectiondrugs,transplantationoforgansandthecontroloftheanti-transplantimmuneresponsehavemade huge strides in the past 50 years.
Today, these procedures are commonplace.
Tissue typing is the determination of MHC molecules in the tissue to be transplanted to better match the donor to the recipient.
The immune response to cancer, on the other hand, has been more difficult to understand and control.
Although it is clear that the immune system can recognize some cancers and control them, others seem to be resistant to immune mechanisms.
The Rh Factor Red blood cells can be typed based on their surface antigens.
ABO blood type, in which individuals are type A, B, AB, or O according to their genetics, is one example.
A separate antigen system seen on red blood cells is the Rh antigen.
When someone is ‚ÄúA positive‚Äù for example, the positive refers to the presence of the Rh antigen, whereas someone who is ‚ÄúA negative‚Äù would lack this molecule.
An interesting consequence of Rh factor expression is seen in erythroblastosis fetalis , a hemolytic disease of the newborn (Figure 21.30).
This disease occurs when mothers negative for Rh antigen have multiple Rh-positive children.
During the birth of a first Rh-positive child, the mother makes a primary anti-Rh antibody response to the fetal blood cells thatenterthematernalbloodstream.IfthemotherhasasecondRh-positivechild,IgGantibodiesagainstRh-positiveblood mountedduringthissecondaryresponsecrosstheplacentaandattackthefetalblood,causinganemia.Thisisaconsequence of the fact that the fetus is not genetically identical to the mother, and thus the mother is capable of mounting an immune response against it.
This disease is treated with antibodies specific for Rh factor.
These are given to the mother during the subsequent births, destroying any fetal blood that might enter her system and preventing the immune response.958 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 21.30 Erythroblastosis Fetalis Erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) is the result of an immune response in an Rh-negative mother who has multiple children with an Rh-positive father.
During the first birth, fetal blood enters the mother‚Äôs circulatory system, and anti-Rh antibodies are made.
During the gestation of the second child, these antibodies cross the placenta and attack the blood of the fetus.
The treatment for this disease is to give the mother anti-Rh antibodies (RhoGAM) during the first pregnancy to destroy Rh-positive fetal red blood cells from entering her system and causing the anti-Rh antibody response in the first place.
Tissue Transplantation TissuetransplantationismorecomplicatedthanbloodtransfusionsbecauseoftwocharacteristicsofMHCmolecules.These molecules are the major cause of transplant rejection (hence the name ‚Äúhistocompatibility‚Äù).
MHC polygeny refers to the multiple MHC proteins on cells, and MHC polymorphism refers to the multiple alleles for each individual MHC locus.
Thus, there are many alleles in the human population that can be expressed (Table 21.8 andTable 21.9).
When a donor organexpressesMHCmoleculesthataredifferentfromtherecipient,thelatterwilloftenmountacytotoxicTcellresponse to the organ and reject it.
Histologically, if a biopsy of a transplanted organ exhibits massive infiltration of T lymphocytes within the first weeks after transplant, it is a sign that the transplant is likely to fail.
The response is a classical, and very specific, primary T cell immune response.
As far as medicine is concerned, the immune response in this scenario does the patient no good at all and causes significant harm.

In humans, there are six MHC molecules that show the most polymorphisms, three class I molecules (A,B,andC)andthreeclassIImoleculescalledDP,DQ,andDR.Asuccessfultransplantusuallyrequiresamatchbetween at least 3‚Äì4 of these molecules, with more matches associated with greater success.
Family members, since they share a similar genetic background, are much more likely to share MHC molecules than unrelated individuals do.
In fact, due to theextensivepolymorphismsintheseMHCmolecules,unrelateddonorsarefoundonlythroughaworldwidedatabase.The system is not foolproof however, as there are not enough individuals in the system to provide the organs necessary to treat all patients needing them.
Onediseaseoftransplantationoccurswithbonemarrowtransplants,whichareusedtotreatvariousdiseases,including SCID and leukemia.
Because the bone marrow cells being transplanted contain lymphocytes capable of mounting an immune response, and because the recipient‚Äôs immune response has been destroyed before receiving the transplant, the donor cells may attack the recipient tissues, causing graft-versus-host disease.
Symptoms of this disease, which usually include a rash and damage to the liver and mucosa, are variable, and attempts have been made to moderate the disease by first removing mature T cells from the donor bone marrow before transplanting it.
Immune Responses Against Cancer It is clear that with some cancers, for example Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma, a healthy immune system does a good job at controlling them (Figure 21.31 ).
This disease, which is caused by the human herpesvirus, is almost never observed in individuals with strong immune systems, such as the young and immunocompetent.
Other examples of cancers caused by viruses include liver cancer caused by the hepatitis B virus and cervical cancer caused by the human papilloma virus.
As these last two viruses have vaccines available for them, getting vaccinated can help prevent these two types of cancer by stimulating the immune response.960 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 Figure 21.31 Karposi‚Äôs Sarcoma Lesions (credit: National Cancer Institute) On the other hand, as cancer cells are often able to divide and mutate rapidly, they may escape the immune response, just as certain pathogens such as HIV do.
There are three stages in the immune response to many cancers: elimination, equilibrium, and escape.
Elimination occurs when the immune response first develops toward tumor-specific antigens specific to the cancer and actively kills most cancer cells, followed by a period of controlled equilibrium during which the remaining cancer cells are held in check.
Unfortunately, many cancers mutate, so they no longer express any specific antigensfortheimmunesystemtorespondto,andasubpopulationofcancercellsescapestheimmuneresponse,continuing the disease process.
This fact has led to extensive research in trying to develop ways to enhance the early immune response to completely eliminate the early cancer and thus prevent a later escape.
One method that has shown some success is the use of cancer vaccines, which differ from viral and bacterial vaccines in that they are directed against the cells of one‚Äôs own body.
Treated cancer cells are injected into cancer patients to enhance their anti-cancer immune response and thereby prolong survival.
The immune system has the capability to detect these cancer cells and proliferate faster than the cancer cells do, overwhelming the cancer in a similar way as they do for viruses.
Cancer vaccines have been developed for malignant melanoma,ahighlyfatalskincancer,andrenal(kidney)cellcarcinoma.Thesevaccinesarestillinthedevelopmentstages, but some positive and encouraging results have been obtained clinically .
It is tempting to focus on the complexity of the immune system and the problems it causes as a negative.
The upside to immunity, however, is so much greater: The benefit of staying alive far outweighs the negatives caused when the system doessometimesgoawry.Workingon‚Äúautopilot,‚Äùtheimmunesystemhelpstomaintainyourhealthandkillpathogens.The onlytimeyoureallymisstheimmuneresponseiswhenitisnotbeingeffectiveandillnessresults,or,asintheextremecase of HIV disease, the immune system is gone completely.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 961 How Stress Affects the Immune Response: The Connections between the Immune, Nervous, and Endocrine Systems of the Body The immune system cannot exist in isolation.
After all, it has to protect the entire body from infection.
Therefore, the immune system is required to interact with other organ systems, sometimes in complex ways.
Thirty years of research focusing on the connections between the immune system, the central nervous system, and the endocrine system have led to a new science with the unwieldy name of called psychoneuroimmunology.
The physical connections betweenthesesystemshavebeenknownforcenturies:Allprimaryandsecondaryorgansareconnectedtosympathetic nerves.
What is more complex, though, is the interaction of neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and other soluble signaling molecules, and the mechanism of ‚Äúcrosstalk‚Äù between the systems.
For example, white blood cells, including lymphocytes and phagocytes, have receptors for various neurotransmitters released by associated neurons.
Additionally, hormones such as cortisol (naturally produced by the adrenal cortex) and prednisone (synthetic) are well known for their abilities to suppress T cell immune mechanisms, hence, their prominent use in medicine as long-term, anti-inflammatory drugs.
Onewell-establishedinteractionoftheimmune,nervous,andendocrinesystemsistheeffectofstressonimmune health.
In the human vertebrate evolutionary past, stress was associated with the fight-or-flight response, largely mediated by the central nervous system and the adrenal medulla.
This stress was necessary for survival.
The physical action of fighting or running, whichever the animal decides, usually resolves the problem in one way or another.
On the other hand, there are no physical actions to resolve most modern day stresses, including short-term stressors like taking examinations and long-term stressors such as being unemployed or losing a spouse.
The effect of stress can be felt by nearly every organ system, and the immune system is no exception ( Table 21.10).
Effects of Stress on Body Systems System Stress-related illness Integumentary system Acne, skin rashes, irritation Nervous systemHeadaches, depression, anxiety, irritability, loss of appetite, lack of motivation, reduced mental performance Muscular and skeletal systemsMuscle and joint pain, neck and shoulder pain Circulatory system Increased heart rate, hypertension, increased probability of heart attacks Digestive systemIndigestion, heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, weight gain or loss Immune system Depressed ability to fight infections Male reproductive systemLowered sperm production, impotence, reduced sexual desire Female reproductive systemIrregular menstrual cycle, reduced sexual desire Table 21.10 At one time, it was assumed that all types of stress reduced all aspects of the immune response, but the last few decades of research have painted a different picture.
First, most short-term stress does not impair the immune system in healthy individuals enough to lead to a greater incidence of diseases.
However, older individuals and those with suppressed immune responses due to disease or immunosuppressive drugs may respond even to short-term stressors by getting sicker more often.
It has been found that short-term stress diverts the body‚Äôs resources towards enhancing innateimmuneresponses,whichhavetheabilitytoactfastandwouldseemtohelpthebodypreparebetterforpossible infections associated with the trauma that may result from a fight-or-flight exchange.
The diverting of resources away from the adaptive immune response, however, causes its own share of problems in fighting disease.
Chronic stress, unlike short-term stress, may inhibit immune responses even in otherwise healthy adults.
The suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses is clearly associated with increases in some diseases, as seen when individuals lose a spouse or have other long-term stresses, such as taking care of a spouse with a fatal962 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 diseaseordementia.Thenewscienceofpsychoneuroimmunology,whilestillinitsrelativeinfancy,hasgreatpotential to make exciting advances in our understanding of how the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems have evolved together and communicate with each other.CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 963 active immunity acute inflammation adaptive immune response afferent lymphatic vessels antibody antigen presentation antigen processing antigen receptor antigen antigenic determinant B cells barrier defenses bone marrow bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) central tolerance chemokine chronic inflammation chyle cisterna chyli class switching clonal anergy clonal deletion clonal expansion clonal selection clone complement constant region domain cytokine cytotoxic T cells (Tc)KEY TERMS immunity developed from an individual‚Äôs own immune system inflammation occurring for a limited time period;

Many immune system cells use the lymphatic and circulatory systems for transport throughout the body to search for and then protect against pathogens.
21.2 Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response Innate immune responses are critical to the early control of infections.
Whereas barrier defenses are the body‚Äôs first line of physical defense against pathogens, innate immune responses are the first line of physiological defense.
Innate responses occurrapidly,butwithlessspecificityandeffectivenessthantheadaptiveimmuneresponse.Innateresponsescanbecaused by a variety of cells, mediators, and antibacterial proteins such as complement.
Within the first few days of an infection, another series of antibacterial proteins are induced, each with activities against certain bacteria, including opsonization of certain species.
Additionally, interferons are induced that protect cells from viruses in their vicinity.
Finally, the innate immune response does not stop when the adaptive immune response is developed.
In fact, both can cooperate and one can influence the other in their responses against pathogens.
21.3 The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types T cells recognize antigens with their antigen receptor, a complex of two protein chains on their surface.
They do not recognize self-antigens, however, but only processed antigen presented on their surfaces in a binding groove of a major histocompatibility complex molecule.
T cells develop in the thymus, where they learn to use self-MHC molecules to recognize only foreign antigens, thus making them tolerant to self-antigens.
There are several functional types of T lymphocytes, the major ones being helper, regulatory, and cytotoxic T cells.
21.4 The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes and Antibodies B cells, which develop within the bone marrow, are responsible for making five different classes of antibodies, each with its own functions.
B cells have their own mechanisms for tolerance, but in peripheral tolerance, the B cells that leave the bonemarrowremaininactiveduetoTcelltolerance.SomeBcellsdonotneedTcellcytokinestomakeantibody,andthey bypass this need by the crosslinking of their surface immunoglobulin by repeated carbohydrate residues found in the cell walls of many bacterial species.
Others require T cells to become activated.
21.5 The Immune Response against Pathogens Early childhood is a time when the body develops much of its immunological memory that protects it from diseases in adulthood.
The components of the immune response that have the maximum effectiveness against a pathogen are often associated with the class of pathogen involved.
Bacteria and fungi are especially susceptible to damage by complement proteins, whereas viruses are taken care of by interferons and cytotoxic T cells.
Worms are attacked by eosinophils.
Pathogens have shown the ability, however, to evade the body‚Äôs immune responses, some leading to chronic infections or even death.
The immune system and pathogens are in a slow, evolutionary race to see who stays on top.
Modern medicine, hopefully, will keep the results skewed in humans‚Äô favor.
21.6 Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses Theimmuneresponsecanbeunder-reactiveorover-reactive.Suppressedimmunitycanresultfrominheritedgeneticdefects orbyacquiringviruses.Over-reactiveimmuneresponsesincludethehypersensitivities:Bcell-andTcell-mediatedimmune responses designed to control pathogens, but that lead to symptoms or medical complications.
The worst cases of over- reactive immune responses are autoimmune diseases, where an individual‚Äôs immune system attacks his or her own body because of the breakdown of immunological tolerance.
These diseases are more common in the aged, so treating them will be a challenge in the future as the aged population in the world increases.
21.7 Transplantation and Cancer Immunology Blood transfusion and organ transplantation both require an understanding of the immune response to prevent medical complications.
Blood needs to be typed so that natural antibodies against mismatched blood will not destroy it, causing more harm than good to the recipient.
Transplanted organs must be matched by their MHC molecules and, with the use of immunosuppressive drugs, can be successful even if an exact tissue match cannot be made.
Another aspect to the immune response is its ability to control and eradicate cancer.
Although this has been shown to occur with some rare cancers and968 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6 those caused by known viruses, the normal immune response to most cancers is not sufficient to control cancer growth.
Thus, cancer vaccines designed to enhance these immune responses show promise for certain types of cancer .
