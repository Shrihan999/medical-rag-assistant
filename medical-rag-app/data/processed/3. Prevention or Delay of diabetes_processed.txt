PREVENTION OR DELAY OF DIABETESS50 Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S50/791483/dc25s003.pdf by guest on 22 April 2025 complications during which one can inter- vene.
Once identi ﬁed, several effective therapeutic approaches exist that can de-lay type 2 diabetes in those with prediabe- tes with an A1C 5.7 –6.4% (39 –47 mmol/ mol), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or impaired fasting glucose (IFG).
The util- ity of screening with A1C for prediabe-tes and diabetes may be limited in the presence of certain hemoglobinopa- thies and conditions that affect redblood cell turnover ( Table 2.3 ).
See Sec- tion 2, “Diagnosis and Classi ﬁcation of Diabetes, ”and Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia, ”for additional details on the appropriate use and limitations of A1C testing.
Three distinct stages of type 1 diabetes have been de ﬁned, with symptomatic type 1 diabetes being stage 3 ( Table 2.4 ).
In individuals at risk for developingclinical type 1 diabetes, younger age of seroconversion (particularly under age 3 years), the total number of diabetes-related autoantibodies (1), and the de- velopment of autoantibodies against islet antigen 2 (IA-2) have been associatedwith a more rapid progression to clinical type 1 diabetes.
While continuous glu- cose monitoring can predict progressionto overt diabetes in children with autoan- tibodies (2), OGTT-based metrics appear to be better at predicting progressioncompared with continuous glucose moni- toring (3).

LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR CHANGE FOR TYPE 2 DIABETESPREVENTION Recommendations 3.3Refer adults with overweight or obesity at high risk of type 2 diabe- tes, as seen in the Diabetes Preven-tion Program (DPP), to an intensivelifestyle behavior change program to achieve and maintain a weight reduc- tion of at least 7% of initial bodyweight through healthy reduced-caloriediet and $150 min/week of moder- ate-intensity physical activity.
A3.4Prescribe an eating pattern known to be effective in preventing type 2 dia- betes to individuals with prediabetes.
A variety of eating patterns, such as Mediterranean style, intermittent fast- ing, and low carbohydrate, have shownbeneﬁt.B 3.5Given the cost-effectiveness of life- style behavior modi ﬁcation programs for diabetes prevention, such diabetes prevention programs should be offered to adults at high risk of type 2 diabetes.
A Diabetes prevention programs should be covered by third-party payors, andinconsistencies in access should be ad- dressed.
E 3.6 Based on individual preference, certiﬁed technology-assisted diabetes prevention programs may be effective in preventing type 2 diabetes and should be considered.
B The Diabetes Prevention Program Several major randomized controlled tri- als, including the Diabetes PreventionProgram (DPP) trial (5), the Finnish Diabe- tes Prevention Study (DPS) (6), and the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study (DaQing study) (7), demonstrate that life- style/behavioral intervention with an in- dividualized reduced-calorie meal plan is highly effective in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes and improving other car-diometabolic risk factors (such as blood pressure, lipids, and in ﬂammation) (8).
The strongest evidence for diabetes pre- v e n t i o ni nt h eU .
S .c o m e sf r o mt h eD P P trial (5).
The DPP demonstrated that in-tensive lifestyle intervention could reduce the risk of incident type 2 diabetes by 58% over 3 years.
Follow-up of threelarge trials of lifestyle intervention for dia- betes prevention showed sustained re- duction in the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes: 39% reduction at 30 years in the Da Qing study (9), 43% reduction at 7 yearsin the Finnish DPS (6), and 34% reduction at 10 years (10) and 27% reduction at 15 years (11) in the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS).
The DPP lifestyle intervention was a goal-based intervention.
All participants were given the same weight loss and physical activity goals, but individualiza- tion was permitted to achieve the goals(12).
The two major goals of the DPP in- tensive lifestyle intervention were to achieve and maintain a minimum of 7%weight loss and to partake in 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity perweek, such as brisk walking.
Althoughweight loss was the most important factorin reducing the risk of incident diabetes, achieving the behavioral goal of at least 150 min of physical activity per week,even without achieving the weight lossgoal, reduced the incidence of type 2 dia- betes by 44% (13).
The 7% weight loss goal was selected because it was feasible to achieve andmaintain and likely to lessen the risk of de-veloping diabetes (as well as improve other cardiometabolic risk factors).
Partici- pants were encouraged to achieve the$7% weight loss during the ﬁrst 6 months of the intervention.
Further analysis sug- gests higher bene ﬁt for prevention of dia- betes with at least 7 –10% weight loss with lifestyle interventions (13).
The recom-mended pace of weight loss was 1 –2 lb/week.
Calorie goals were calculated by estimating the daily calories neededto maintain the participant ’s initial weight and subtracting 500 –1,000 calories/day (depending on initial body weight).
The initial focus of the nutrition interventionwas on reducing total fat rather than cal-ories.
After several weeks, the conceptsof calorie balance and the need to restrict calories and fat were introduced (12).
The goal for physical activity was selected to approximate at least 700 kcal/week ex-penditure from physical activity.
For easeof translation, this goal was described as at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, similar in in-tensity to brisk walking.
Participants wereencouraged to distribute their activity throughout the week with a minimum frequency of three times per week andat least 10 min per session.
A maximumof 75 min of strength training could be applied toward the total 150 min/week physical activity goal (12).
To implement the weight loss and phys- ical activity goals, the DPP used an individ-ual model of treatment rather than a group-based approach.
This choice was based on a desire to intervene before par-ticipants had the possibility of developingdiabetes or losing interest in the program.
The individual approach also allowed for the tailoring of interventions to re ﬂect the diversity of the population (12).
The DPP intervention was administered a sas t r u c t u r e dc o r ec u r r i c u l u mf o l l o w e d by a ﬂexible maintenance program of individual counseling, group sessions,diabetesjournals.org/care Prevention or Delay of Diabetes S51Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S50/791483/dc25s003.pdf by guest on 22 April 2025 motivational campaigns, and restart opportunities.
The 16-session core cur- riculum was completed within the ﬁrst 24 weeks of the program.
It included ses- sions on lowering calories, increasing physical activity, self-monitoring, main-taining healthy lifestyle behaviors (such as how to choose healthy food options when eating out), and guidance on manag-ing psychological, social, and motivationalchallenges (12).
While the DPP interventions were suc- cessful in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes, long-term effects onclinically meaningful events (microvascu- lar and macrovascular disease) have not been established (14).
However, there ispotential bene ﬁtw i t h o u tt h er i s ko fh a r m with these interventions.
Nutrition Nutrition counseling for weight loss in the DPP lifestyle intervention arm included a reduction of total fat and calories (5,12,13).However, evidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all peo-ple to prevent diabetes; therefore, macro- nutrient distribution should be based on an individualized assessment of currenteating patterns, preferences, and meta-bolic goals (15).
Based on other trials, a va- riety of eating patterns (15,16) may also be appropriate for individuals with prediabe-tes (15), including Mediterranean-style and low-carbohydrate eating plans (17 –19).
Ob- servational studies have also shown thatvegetarian, plant-based (may include some animal products), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pat-terns are associated with a lower risk ofdeveloping type 2 diabetes (20 –23).
Ev- idence suggests that the overall quality of food consumed (as measured by theHealthy Eating Index, Alternative Healthy Eating Index, and DASH score), with an emphasis on whole grains, legumes,nuts, fruits, and vegetables and minimal reﬁned and processed foods, is also asso- ciated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes(22,24,25).
As is the case for those withdiabetes, individualized medical nutrition therapy (see Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-beingto Improve Health Outcomes, ”for more detailed information) is effective in low- ering A1C in individuals diagnosed withprediabetes (26).Physical Activity Moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking for 150 min/week, has shown bene ﬁcial effects in those with pre- diabetes (5).
Similarly, moderate-intensityphysical activity has been shown to im-prove insulin sensitivity and reduce ab-dominal fat in children and young adults(27,28).
Health care professionals are en-couraged to promote a DPP-style pro- gram to all individuals who have been identi ﬁed to be at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
In addition to aerobic ac-tivity, a physical activity plan designed toprevent diabetes may include resistancetraining (12,29).
Breaking up prolongedsedentary time may also be encouraged, as it lowers postprandial glucose levels (30).
The effects of physical activity ap-pear to extend to the prevention of ges-tational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (31).
Sleep Characteristics Associated With Increased Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Sleep occupies approximately one-third of the day for most people and modu-lates a variety of metabolic, endocrine,and cardiovascular processes (32).
Thelatest ADA-EASD consensus report on management of hyperglycemia highlights sleep as a central component in themanagement of prediabetes and type 2diabetes, placing it, for the ﬁrst time, on the same level as other lifestyle behav-iors (e.g., physical activity and nutrition)(33).
Sleep can be characterized using three key constructs: quantity, quality, and timing (i.e., chronotype).
There isnow established evidence for a U-shapedassociation between sleep duration andtype 2 diabetes incidence, with the nadirtypically occurring at 7 h per day, withshort (typically de ﬁned as <6h )a n d long (typically de ﬁned as >9 h) sleep du- ration having up to a 50% increase in therisk of type 2 diabetes, including progres-sion from prediabetes (33).
Sleep qualityhas recently been de ﬁned as “an individ- ual’s self-satisfaction with all aspects of the sleep experience ”(34,35).
Poor sleep quality was associated with a 40 –84% in- creased risk of developing type 2 diabe-tes in a meta-analysis (36).
Chronotypepreference has been linked with manychronic diseases, including type 2 diabe-tes.
For example, for those with a prefer- ence for evenings (i.e., going to bed late and getting up late), there was a 2.5-foldhigher odds ratio for type 2 diabetesthan for those with a preference formornings (i.e., going to bed early and getting up early), independent of sleep duration and sleep suf ﬁciency (37).
Delivery and Dissemination of Lifestyle Behavior Change for Diabetes Prevention Because the intensive lifestyle interven- tion in the DPP was effective in prevent-ing type 2 diabetes among those at high risk for the disease and lifestyle behavior change programs for diabetes preventionwere shown to be cost-effective, broaderefforts to disseminate scalable lifestyle behavior change programs for diabetes prevention with coverage by third-partypayors ensued (38 –42).
Group delivery of DPP content in community or primary care settings has demonstrated the po-tential to reduce overall program costswhile still producing weight loss and dia- betes risk reduction (43,44).
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention (CDC) developed the National Dia-betes Prevention Program (National DPP), aresource designed to bring such evidence- based lifestyle change programs for pre- venting type 2 diabetes to communities(cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention).
This online resource includes locations of CDC-recog- nized diabetes prevention lifestyle changeprograms (cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/ﬁnd-a-program.html).
To be eligible for this program, individuals must have a BMI in the overweight range and be atrisk for diabetes based on laboratory test- ing, a previous diagnosis of GDM, or a positive risk test (cdc.gov/prediabetes/risktest/).
During the ﬁrst 4 years of im- plementation of the CDC ’sN a t i o n a lD P P , 36% achieved the 5% weight loss goal (45).
The CDC has also developed the Dia-betes Prevention Impact Tool Kit (nccd.
cdc.gov/toolkit/diabetesimpact) to help organizations assess the economics ofproviding or covering the National DPP(46).
To expand preventive services using a cost-effective model, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expandedMedicare reimbursement coverage for the National DPP to organizations recog- nized by the CDC that become Medicaresuppliers for this service (innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/medicare-diabetes- prevention-program).
The locations of Medicare DPPs are available online atinnovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/ medicare-diabetes-prevention-program/ mdpp-map.
To qualify for Medicarecoverage, individuals must have BMIS52 Prevention or Delay of Diabetes Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S50/791483/dc25s003.pdf by guest on 22 April 2025 >25 kg/m2(or BMI >23 kg/m2if self- identi ﬁed as Asian) and glycemic testing consistent with prediabetes in the lastyear.
Medicaid DPP is also expandingon a state-by-state basis.
While CDC-recognized behavioral counseling programs, including Medi-care DPP services, have met minimumquality standards and are reimbursedby many payors, lower retention rates have been reported for younger adults and racial and ethnic minoritized popu-lations (47).
Therefore, other programsand modalities of behavioral counsel- ing for diabetes prevention may also be appropriate and ef ﬁcacious based on individual preferences and availabil-ity.
The use of community health work- ers to support DPP-like interventions has been shown to be effective andcost-effective (48,49) (see Section 1,“Improving Care and Promoting Health in Populations, ”for more information).
The use of community health workers may facilitate the adoption of behaviorchanges for diabetes prevention whilebridging barriers related to social deter- minants of health.
However, coverage by third-party payors remains limited.Counseling by a registered dietitian/nutritionist (RDN) has been shown to help individuals with prediabetes improve eating habits, increase physical activity, andachieve 7 –10% weight loss (15,50 –52).
In- dividualized medical nutrition therapy (seeSection 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes, ”for more detailed information) is also effective in improv-ing glycemia in individuals diagnosed with prediabetes (26,50).
Furthermore, trials involving medical nutrition ther-apy for adults with prediabetes foundsigniﬁcant reductions in weight, waist circumference, and glycemia (23,26).
Individuals with prediabetes can bene ﬁt from referral to an RDN for individualizedmedical nutrition therapy upon diagnosisand at regular intervals throughout their treatment plan (51,53).
Other health care professionals, such as pharmacists and dia-betes care and education specialists, mayalso be considered for diabetes prevention efforts (53,54).
Technology-assisted programs may ef- fectively deliver a DPP-like intervention(55–58).
A digital diabetes prevention program improved cardiovascular risk at 4m o n t h sb u tn o ta t1 2m o n t h s( 5 9 ) .
Such technology-assisted programs maydeliver content through smartphones, web-based applications, and telehealthand may be an acceptable and ef ﬁca- cious option to bridge barriers, particu- larly for individuals with low income and/or in rural locations; however, notall technology-assisted programs are ef-fective (55,60 –62).
The CDC Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) (cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/requirements-recognition.htm) certi ﬁes technology- assisted modalities as effective vehicles for DPP-based interventions; such pro-grams must use an approved curricu-lum, include interaction with a coach, a n da t t a i nt h eD P Po u t c o m e so fp a r t i c i - pation, physical activity reporting, andweight loss.
Health care professionalsshould consider referring adults with pre- diabetes to certi ﬁed technology-assisted programs.
PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS TO DELAY TYPE 2 DIABETES Recommendations 3.7Metformin for the prevention of type 2 diabetes should be consideredin adults at high risk of type 2 diabetes, as typi ﬁed by the DPP , especially those aged 25 –59 years with BMI $35 kg/m 2, higher fasting plasma glucose (e.g., $110 mg/dL [ $6 mmol/L]), and higher A1C (e.g., $6.0% [$42 mmol/mol]), and in individuals with prior gestational diabetes mellitus.
A 3.8Long-term use of metformin may be associated with vitamin B12 de ﬁ- ciency; consider periodic assessment of vitamin B12 level in metformin- treated individuals, especially in thosewith anemia or peripheral neuropa- thy.B Because weight loss through behavior changes in nutrition and physical activity may not be suf ﬁcient on their own and can be dif ﬁcult to maintain long term (10), some people at high risk of type 2 diabe- tes may bene ﬁt from additional support and pharmacotherapeutic options.
Vari-ous pharmacologic agents used to treat di-abetes have been evaluated for diabetes prevention.
Metformin, a-glucosidase in- hibitors, incretin receptor agonists (e.g.,liraglutide and semaglutide), thiazolidine-diones, and insulin have been shown to lower the incidence of diabetes in speci ﬁc populations (63 –68), whereas diabetesprevention was not seen with nateglinide (69).
In the DPP, weight loss was an impor- tant factor in reducing the risk of pro-gression, with every kilogram of weight loss conferring a 16% reduction in risk of progression over 3.2 years (13).
In in-dividuals with previous history of GDM,the risk of type 2 diabetes increased by18% for every 1 unit BMI above the pre- conception baseline (70).
Several medi- cations evaluated for weight loss (e.g.,orlistat, phentermine and topiramate,liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) have been shown to decrease the inci- dence of type 2 diabetes in those withprediabetes (68,71 –73).
Studies of other pharmacologic agents have shown some ef ﬁcacy in diabetes prevention with valsartan or testoster- one (74,75) but no ef ﬁcacy in preventing diabetes with ramipril or anti-in ﬂamma- tory drugs (75 –78).
Vitamin D therapy has recently been advocated by the U.S. Endocrine Society to prevent progressionof high-risk prediabetes to type 2 diabetesin adults (79).
Three randomized con-trolled trials have been designed and con- ducted to test whether vitamin D therapy in combination with lifestyle modi ﬁcation reduces the risk of developing diabetes inadults with high-risk prediabetes (i.e., IGT or meeting two or three ADA prediabetes glycemic criteria [fasting glucose, A1C, 2-hglucose after a 75-g OGTT]): the Tromsøstudy in Norway, with 511 participants; the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study in the U.S., with 2,423 participants;and the Diabetes Prevention with ActiveV i t a m i nD( D P V D )s t u d yi nJ a p a n ,w i t h1,256 participants (80 –82).
Although vita- min D therapy modestly reduced the risk of developing diabetes compared with theplacebo to a nearly identical degree in allthree trials, none of the results of the indi- vidual studies were statistically signi ﬁcant (reportedly due to insuf ﬁcient power).
Subsequently, several meta-analyses re-lated to these (and other smaller) studies have suggested a modest potential bene ﬁt in speci ﬁc populations (83,84).
However, there are several concerns and uncertain- ties regarding recommending widespreadvitamin D therapy for adults with high- risk prediabetes.
1) The recommended vitamin D dose is unclear.
The includedtrials used varying dosages of vitamin Dthat were higher than the recommended daily allowance for this population (i.e., 600 IU/day for those aged 18 –70 yearsdiabetesjournals.org/care Prevention or Delay of Diabetes S53Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S50/791483/dc25s003.pdf by guest on 22 April 2025 and 800 IU for those older than 70 years).
Due to this variability, it is not possible to recommend a speci ﬁc vitamin D dosage for diabetes prevention.
2) The bene ﬁt-to- risk ratio of vitamin D therapy for high-riskprediabetes remains uncertain.
Although there was no evidence of safety concerns with vitamin D therapy in study partici-pants with prediabetes, the numbers ofadults included in these studies are smallcompared with the potentially many mil-lions of adults with prediabetes in the U.S. and globally who may have risk of adverse events if treated with unspeci ﬁed doses of vitamin D without monitoring blood25-hydroxy vitamin D levels.
In light ofthese and other issues, further research is warranted to better de ﬁne the popu- lation characteristics and determine thedose and clinical pathway of vitamin Dtherapy for diabetes prevention.
No pharmacologic agent has been ap- proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration for prevention of type 2 diabetes.
The risk versus bene ﬁt of each medication in support of person-centered goals mustbe weighed in addition to cost and burdenof administration.
Additionally, pharmaco-logic interventions must be long-termbecause of the waning of effect after stopping the medication.
Metformin Metformin has the most safety data as a pharmacologic therapy for diabetesprevention (85).
Metformin was overallless effective than lifestyle modi ﬁcation in the DPP , though group differences at-tenuated over time in the DPPOS (11), and metformin may be cost-saving over a 10-year period (40).
In the DPP, metforminwas as effective as lifestyle modi ﬁcation in participants with BMI $35 kg/m 2and in younger participants aged 25 –44 years (5).
In individuals with a history of GDM in the DPP, metformin and intensive lifestylemodiﬁcation led to an equivalent 50% re- duction in diabetes risk (86).
Both inter-ventions remained highly effective duringa 10-year follow-up period (87).
By the time of the 15-year follow-up (DPPOS), ex- ploratory analyses demonstrated that par-ticipants with a higher baseline fastingglucose ( $110 mg/dL [ $6 mmol/L] vs. 95–109 mg/dL [5.3 –5.9 mmol/L]), those with ah i g h e rA 1 C( 6 .
0 –6.4% [42 –46 mmol/mol] vs.<6.0% [<42 mmol/mol]), and individ- uals with a history of GDM (vs. individualswithout a history of GDM) experiencedhigher risk reductions with metformin, identifying subgroups of participants thatmay bene ﬁt the most from metformin (88).
In the Indian Diabetes PreventionProgram (IDPP-1), metformin and lifestyleintervention reduced diabetes risk simi-larly at 30 months; however, the lifestyleintervention in IDPP-1 was less intensivethan that in the DPP (89).
Based on ﬁnd- ings from the DPP, metformin should berecommended as an option for high-risk individuals (e.g., younger individuals, those with history of GDM, or those with BMI$35 kg/m 2).
Decreased vitamin B12 levels are a known consequence of long-term treat-ment with metformin (90).
Periodic as-sessment of vitamin B12 level in thosetaking metformin chronically should beconsidered to check for possible de ﬁ- ciency, especially in those receiving ahigher dose (e.g.
$1,500 mg/day) (91) or longer treatment duration and in those with existing risk factors.
VitaminB12 serum levels should be tested if de-ﬁciency is suspected, such as in people with anemia or peripheral neuropathy(90,92) (see Section 9, “Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment, ”for more details).
The effect of metforminon vitamin B12 increases with time (93),with a higher risk for vitamin B12 de ﬁ- ciency (<200 pg/mL [ <150 pmol/L]) noted at 4 –5 years of treatment.
A person who has been taking metformin for more than4 years or is at risk for vitamin B12 de ﬁ- ciency for other reasons (e.g., vegan die-tary pattern, previous gastric/small bowelsurgery) should be monitored for vitaminB12 de ﬁciency annually (94).
PREVENTION OF VASCULAR DISEASE AND MORTALITY Recommendations 3.9 Prediabetes is associated with heightened cardiovascular risk; there-fore, screening for and treatment of modiﬁable risk factors for cardiovascu- lar disease are suggested.
B 3.10 Statin therapy may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabe- tes.
In such individuals, glucose statusshould be monitored regularly and di-abetes prevention approaches rein- forced.
It is not recommended that statins be avoided or discontinued forthis adverse effect.
B3.11 In people with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance andprediabetes, pioglitazone may be con- sidered to lower the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction.
However, this beneﬁt needs to be balanced with the increased risk of weight gain, edema,and fractures.
ALower doses may mit- igate the risk of adverse effects but may be less effective.
C People with prediabetes often have other cardiovascular risk factors, including hy- pertension and dyslipidemia (95), and areat increased risk for cardiovascular disease(96,97).
Evaluation for tobacco use and re- ferral for tobacco cessation should be part of routine care for those at risk for diabe-tes.
Of note, the years immediately follow-ing smoking cessation may represent a time of increased risk for diabetes (98,99), and individuals should be monitoredfor diabetes development and receive evidence-based lifestyle behavior change for diabetes prevention as described inthis section.
See Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes, ”for more detailed information.
The lifestyle inter-ventions for weight loss in study popula-tions at risk for type 2 diabetes have s h o w nar e d u c t i o ni nc a r d i o v a s c u l a rr i s k factors and the need for medications usedto treat these cardiovascular risk factors (100,101).
The lifestyle intervention in the Da Qing study was associated with lower-ing cardiovascular disease and mortalityat 23 and 30 years of observational follow-up (7,9).
Treatment goals and ther- apies for hypertension and dyslipidemia inthe primary and secondary prevention ofcardiovascular disease for people with prediabetes should be based on their level of cardiovascular risk.
Increased vigilanceis warranted to identify and treat these and other cardiovascular disease risk fac- tors (102).
Statin use increases risk of dia-betes (103 –105).
In the DPP, statin use was associated with greater diabetes risk irre- spective of the treatment group (pooled hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI] for incident dia-betes 1.36 [1.17 –1.58]) (104).
In trials of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascularand mortality bene ﬁts of statin therapy exceed the risk of diabetes (106,107), suggesting a highly favorable bene ﬁt-to- harm balance with statin therapy.
Hence,discontinuation of statins due to concernsS54 Prevention or Delay of Diabetes Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S50/791483/dc25s003.pdf by guest on 22 April 2025 of diabetes risk is not recommended in this population.
Cardiovascular outcome trials in people without diabetes also inform risk reduc-tion potential in people without diabetes at increased cardiometabolic risk (see Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management, ”for more details).
The IRIS (Insulin Resistance Interventionafter Stroke) trial of people with a recent (<6 months) stroke or transient ischemic attack, without diabetes but with insulinresistance (as de ﬁned by a HOMA of in- sulin resistance index of $3.0), evaluated pioglitazone (goal dose of 45 mg daily) compared with placebo.
At 4.8 years, therisk of stroke or myocardial infarction, aswell as the risk of diabetes, was lower inthe pioglitazone group than in the pla- cebo group; weight gain, edema, and fractures were higher in the pioglitazonetreatment group (108 –110).
Lower doses may mitigate the adverse effects but may also be less effective (111).
PERSON-CENTERED CARE GOALS Recommendations 3.12 In adults with overweight or obesity at high risk of type 2 diabetes, care goals should include weight loss and maintenance, minimizing the pro- gression of hyperglycemia, and atten-tion to cardiovascular risk.
B 3.13 Pharmacotherapy (e.g., for weight management, minimizing the progres- sion of hyperglycemia, and cardiovas-cular risk reduction) should be con- sidered to support person-centered care goals.
B 3.14 More intensive preventive ap- proaches should be considered in indi- viduals who are at particularly high risk of progression to diabetes, includingindividuals with BMI $35 kg/m 2, those at higher glucose levels (e.g., fasting plasma glucose 110 –125 mg/dL [6.1–6.9 mmol/L], 2-h postchallenge glu- cose 173 –199 mg/dL [9.6 –11.0 mmol/L], and A1C $6.0% [$42 mmol/mol]), and individuals with a history of gesta- tional diabetes mellitus.
A Individualized risk-to-bene ﬁt ratio should be considered in screening, intervention,and monitoring to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes and associated comorbidities.
Multiple factors, including age, BMI, andother comorbidities, may in ﬂuence therisk of progression to diabetes and life- time risk of complications (112,113).
Pre- diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality (97), which emphasizes the importance of attending to cardiovascular risk in this population.
However, the new diagnosis of prediabetes in older adults (aged >70 years) is less relevant for progres- sion to diabetes, because regression to normoglycemia or death was more fre- quent than progression to diabetes in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (113).
In the DPP, which enrolled high-risk indi- viduals with IGT, elevated fasting glucose, and elevated BMI, the crude incidence of diabetes within the placebo group was 11 cases per 100 person-years, with a cu- mulative 3-year incidence of diabetes of 29% (5).
Characteristics of individuals in the DPP/DPPOS who were at particularly high risk of progression to diabetes (crude incidence of diabetes 14 –22 cases per 100 person-years) included BMI $35 kg/m 2, higher glucose levels (e.g., fasting plasma glucose 110 –125 mg/dL [6.0 –6.9 mmol/L], 2-h postchallenge glucose 173 –199 mg/dL [9.6–11.0 mmol/L], A1C $6.0% [$42 mmol/mol]), or a history of GDM (5,86,87).In contrast, in the community-based ARIC study, observational follow-up of adults with mean age 75 years with laboratory evidence of prediabetes (based on A1C 5.7–6.4% [39 –47 mmol/mol] and/or fasting glucose 100 –125 mg/dL [5.6 –6.9 mmol/L]), but not meeting speci ﬁc BMI criteria, found lower progression to diabetes over 6 years: 9% of those with A1C-de ﬁned prediabetes and 8% of those with IFG (113).
Thus, it is important to individualize the risk-to-bene ﬁt ratio of intervention and consider person-centered goals.
Risk mod- els have generally found a higher bene ﬁt of the intervention in those at highest risk ( 1 3 ) .D i a b e t e sp r e v e n t i o nt r i a l sa n do b s e r - vational studies highlight key principles that may guide person-centered goals.
In the DPP, which enrolled a high-risk popu- lation meeting criteria for overweight or obesity, weight loss was an important me- diator of diabetes prevention or delay, with greater metabolic bene ﬁt seen with greater weight loss (13,114).
In the DPP/ DPPOS, progression to diabetes, duration of diabetes, and mean level of glycemia were important determinants of the de- velopment of microvascular complications(11).
Achieving normal glucose regulation, even once, during the DPP was associatedwith a lower risk of diabetes and lowerrisk of microvascular complications irre-spective of the treatment arm (115).
Ob-servational follow-up of the Da Qing studyalso showed that regression from IGT tonormal glucose tolerance or remainingwith IGT rather than progressing to type 2diabetes at the end of the 6-year interven-tion trial resulted in signi ﬁcantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease and microvascu-lar disease over 30 years (116).
Pharmacotherapy for weight manage- ment and cardiovascular risk reduction(see Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management, ”for more details) can be considered to support individual- ized person-centered goals, with more in- tensive preventive approaches consideredin individuals at high risk of progression.
PREVENTION OR DELAY OF SYMPTOMATIC TYPE 1 DIABETES Lifestyle and Type 1 Diabetes Progression Observational studies suggest that in those with islet autoantibodies, factorsthat may increase b-cell demand, includ- ing less physical activity (117), higher gly- cemic index (118), and total sugar intake (119), are associated with progression to clinical diabetes.
Similar associations havenot been seen in the development of auto- antibodies.
In The Environmental Determi- nants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) longitudinal study, daily minutes spent in moderate to vigorous physical activitywere associated with a reduced risk of pro- gression to type 1 diabetes in children 5–15 years of age with multiple islet auto- antibodies (HR 0.92 [95% CI 0.86 –0.99] per 10-min increase; P= 0.021) (117).
In the Di- abetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY), in children with islet autoantibod- ies, progression to type 1 diabetes was as-sociated with higher glycemic index (HR 2.20 [95% CI 1.17 –4.15]) and total sugar intake (HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.07 –2.85]) (118,119).
In nonobese diabetic mice, an animal model for the development of type 1diabetes, sustained high-glucose drinking signiﬁcantly aggravated islet in ﬂamma- tion and accelerated the onset of type 1diabetes (120).
Lifestyle interventions fo- cusing on such factors in those withdiabetesjournals.org/care Prevention or Delay of Diabetes S55Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S50/791483/dc25s003.pdf by guest on 22 April 2025 stage 1 or stage 2 type 1 diabetes have not yet been reported.
Pharmacologic Interventions to Delay Symptomatic Type 1 Diabetes Recommendation 3.15 Teplizumab-mzwv infusion to de- lay the onset of symptomatic type 1 di-abetes (stage 3) should be discussedwith selected individuals aged $8y e a r s with stage 2 type 1 diabetes.
Treatmentshould be in a setting with appropri-ately trained personnel.
B Teplizumab, a CD3-directed humanized monoclonal antibody engineered to havedecreased Fc receptor binding, has been approved to delay the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes in people 8 years of age and older with stage 2 type 1 diabetes based in part on the results of a singletrial in relatives of people with type 1 di- abetes (121).
In this study, 44 individuals were randomized to a 14-day course of te- plizumab and 32 to placebo.
The median time to stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosisw a s4 8 .
4m o n t h si nt h et e p l i z u m a bg r o u p and 24.4 months in the placebo group.
Type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 19 (43%) participants who received teplizumab and 23 (72%) participants who receivedplacebo (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.22 –0.78]).
In prespeci ﬁed analyses, the presence of HLA-DR4, absence of HLA-DR3, and ab-sence of anti-zinc transporter 8 antibody predicted response to teplizumab (HR 0.20 [95% CI 09.0.45], 0.18 [0.07 –0.45], and 0.07 [0.02 –0.26], respectively).
The most common adverse reactions weretransient lymphopenia (73%) followed by rash (36%).
Numerous clinical studies are being conducted to test methods for prevent- ing or delaying the onset of stage 3type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of autoimmunity without symptoms or for delaying loss of insulin secretory ca-pacity after onset of stage 3, some withpromising results (see ClinicalTrials.gov and TrialNet.org).
