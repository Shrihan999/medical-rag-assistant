", "answer": "The glycogen storage disease is a group of genetic disorders that are characterized by the inability of the body to store glycogen. Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate that is stored in the liver and muscles, and it is important for providing energy to the body. In glycogen storage disease, the body is unable to break down glycogen into glucose, which can lead to a buildup of glycogen in the liver and muscles. This can cause a range of symptoms, from mild to severe, and can be caused by a variety of genetic mutations.
